**12/19/1631 -- 12/20/1631**:

- The Wolfguard pays for curing Elowen's lycanthropy. She will have to stay at the hospital in Tours-en-Savoy until Feb 18 is the return date.

- Grimey, Grig, Elowen, and Balsamara each invest 100 gp in Jaumon Malevol's business venture. Something to do with tulips in the Netherlands. He will write them about his progress in a month's time.

- The Wolfguard Scouts restock supplies in town, welcomes fresh recruits, and returns to Castle Xyntillan.

- They explore to the North, East, and South, encountering another group of ghouls in the process but also securing some treasure.

- As they are exploring in the Southeast, a ghost surprises them. Descending on Sister Margaux and Grig, the ghost claims their lives in terrible fashion. The others flee through a portrait gallery, toward the main entrance. A group of zombies rises from the ground, but they are out of the door toward relative safety before the undead can close.

- They return again to the castle to retrieve the Sister's body. On this foray, they encounter a strange giant toad in a bath. He treats with them and trades a jar of toad poison for a thorough cleaning of its backside. On their way out, they encounter a strange magical beast: a goatrice. Luckily, the beast is slain before it could do too much harm.

- Total treasure retrieved: Silver Goblet (1,000 gp), Silver Dagger (30 gp), Diadem (1,000 gp), Jar of Toad Poison, 16 Pearls (200 gp each).
