**8-9 Pharast 4721**: The Graveyard and the Gauntlight Ruins

- The party battles the Scalathrax in the darkness of the Otari graveyard. Nearly losing Rizzard, they manage to land a killing blow on the beast.

- The townsfolk greet them when exiting the graveyard. The mayor Oseph Menhemes thanks them for their help and asks them to investigate the Gauntlight, ensuring the eerie light will never fall again on the town. He offers 50 gp per person and 25 for the group upfront.

- The group spends 8 Pharast recuperating and securing new gear.

- On 9 Pharast, in the evening, they set out to return to the Gauntlight. 

- They explore the dark ruins and find two small rooms that must have served as offices. They recover several magic potions and find a secret door to a basement level. 

- They also find a chapel in the Northeastern part of the building. Corbin identifies the religious symbols as being associated with an entity called Nhimbaloth--none of the others have heard of it. In the chapel, they are confronted by undead corpses, animated by strange blue lights. After destroying them, they find a Wand of Heal, a scroll, a magical rapier, and a strange amulet.
