**16 Pharast 4721**: The Gauntlight Ruins

- The party leaves the dungeon below the Apprentice's Island. Corbin attends to some personal business, while Rizzard, Arryn, and Zazgaz pursue some quests in Otari.

- Olaria Gallantine, the owner of the local courier service, asks the group to find one of her missing couriers. They follow the Granary Road and stumble upon the petrified centaur courier. Rizzard sneaks through the underbrush but accidentally steps on a fallen tree branch, drawing the attention of a basilisk.

They bring a package of chili peppers to Magiloy and a small collection of metal pins to Klore Hengus, overseer of the Giant Wheel and flume. Magiloy asks them to procure some rare mushrooms from Slab Hill, while Klorte wants them to find the arsonists that have been setting fires in the area. Klorte offers a striking hatchet as a reward.

They enter the dark passage. Facing several undead and magica traps, they find the dead body of a local Half-Orc and several magic items. Some strange warrior was buried in this barrow...
