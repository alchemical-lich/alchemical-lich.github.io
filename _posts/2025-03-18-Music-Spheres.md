**Session 5 Music of the Spheres is Chaos**

The halfling cook joins the party as well as a mysterious Black Cat. They venture into the Earth Sphere and find the Vault of the Lord of the Earth. He commands them to find five gemstones--the Stars of the Dwarven Lords. The party explores the Earth Sphere further. Dodging several dangerous traps, they recover the gemstones but decide to keep them for now. 

They travel through a labyrinth of hallways to the House of the Worm. In a small chamber, they find the Seat of the Philosopher-King. Totine, brave enough to sit on the stone throne, is flooded with deep arcane insights. In the process, he forsakes his bond with Hekanhoda, but learns several new spells. Messi turns on Totino but is quickly dispatched via the Halfling's magical frying pan. Surely, Hekanhoda will look for further retribution...
