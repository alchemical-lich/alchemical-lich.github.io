**10/15/1631 -- 10/28/1631**:

- The Wolfguard travels to Nordhausen to sell the crown of the Carr family to Lutz von Groten, Bishop of Nordhausen.

- On the way, they encounter a group of brigands. Mad Tim charms their leader Peldred and assures safe passage. The birgands lair in the woods to the North (Hex 0111).

- In Nordhausen, they find rooms at the Neuenegg Inn. During the night, a loud gunshot wakes everyone in the Inn. Cr√ºde is the first to investigate. Pistil in hand, wearing his nightgown, he finds the dead body of another guest in a room across the hallway. Before the other guests appear, he is able to snatch the dead man's diary.

- Another guest, Inquisitor Moritz Kirchner, takes over the crime scene and orders everyone back to their rooms as he investigates the apparent suicide.

- The Wolfguard studies the diary and learns that the dead man, Francesco Cagliostro, had been hired by publisher Hans Eberle to find occult artifacts. Cagliostro unsuccessfully searched for the writings of one Raz Ka'Faun in Bruckstadt. More recently, he traveled all over Europe and the Middle East in search of the Crown of Solomon. He became convinced the Order of Templars hid the Crown in Nordhausen. Cagliostro had begun to explore the tunnels under the old Templar Church with a group of adventurers, but something went wrong during the exploration. The final entries are a confusing mess of crazed rantings.

- The next day, the Wolfguard sells several valuable treasure items and convinces the Bishop to cure Magnus from his strange affliction.

- They travel back toward Bruckstadt. On the way, they encounter pack of friendly St. Bernard dogs and hear the news of a bandit raid on Moorbach. Apparently, a group of bandits attacked the town overnight and abducted over a dozen villagers.

- Back in Bruckstadt, the party sells the holy oils and greases to a pleased Cafarelli. They also hire him to dispel the protective glyphs on the two remaining chests recovered from the Cloister of the Frog God. Inside, they find a cache of valuables and magit items.

- The Wolfguard spends 5,000 go to restore their keep. Although some unfortunate accidents increase the costs, their Keep will be completed by 10/30.

- Treasure recovered: 2,200 gp, six saphhires (800 gp each), 2 blocks of orange wax (cast Commune for evil deities), a scroll case with coded documents, 9 potions of healing, 2 potions of extra healing, a potion of poison, a super acid, a potion of speed, a potion of distilled disease, the elixir of all-seeing doom, the Hand of the Revenant.
