**27 Pharast 4721**: Maunder Bridge and Castle

- In the morning, the party seeks an audience with Oseph Menhemes. He sternly receives them in his study, asking pointed questions about their activities in town. They make a convincing case for their heroic contributions in the defense of Otari and the greater threat behind the arson attempts.

- He acknowledges their competence but it takes a good bit of negotiating to get him to agree to a bounty of 100 GP and the support of two town guards to investigate the dwarfs at Maunder Bridge. A short disruption by Oseph' kids seems to weaken his heart--he clearly is a family man.

- While the other shop, Corbin brings a bouquet of beautiful flowers to Worliwynn at the Stone Pond. She blushes and they awkwardly agree to meet for dinner. Worliwynn gifts Corbin a healing potion to keep him safe.

- They make their way towards Maunder Bridge. As they approach, they spot a burly dwarf guarding the bridge. Rizzard incants a few arcane syllables and turns invisible, sneaking over the river, past the dwarf. A hidden leopard catches his smell and goes after him. In the ensuing melee, Rizzard is able to get away, while the others rush the dwarf. A surprisingly difficult battle ensues, the dwarf crushing Zazgaz' knee and caving the skull of one of the guards in. All the while, Rizzard sneaks up to Maunder Keep and scales the walls.

- While the others finally kill the dwarf and his wild pet, Rizzard is attacked by a Gargoyle. Maintaining his invisibility, he jumps down into the courtyard, runs toward the portcullis' winch, and begins lifting the heavy iron barrier. The gargoyle flies after him and bites his neck. A spurt of deep red blood gushes out and covers the dark grey skin of the gargoyle. Rizzard collapses, but the portcullis remains partially lifted. 

- The others break off their attempts and first aid and rush towards Rizzard's aid. Corbin crawls under the portcullis and assesses the threat: he surmises the create has a natural resistance to physical damage--only adamantine weapons being able to penetrate the beast's petrified skin. The gargoyle kills the remaining town guard and flenses Corbin's skin with its claws. Zazgaz and Arryn do their best to protect their companions. Two party members down and two dead guards...at the last moment Arryn sends a desperate prayer to Nethys. Divine energy emanates from everyone and both Corbin and Rizzard regain consciousness while the gargoyle menacingly hovers above the party, it's beady eyes focusing on Zazgaz...
