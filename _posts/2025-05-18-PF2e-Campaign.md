**10 Gozren 4721**: The Laboratory

The party kills the remaining Ghasts in the spa area finds a strange humanoid resting in the sauna. They begin a conversation with the man ma,ed Murschen and learn he is here to fight and get stronger. Jakfaki promised him strong enemies and fleshwarping services. They convince him that they have more to offer and that Arryn can give him two more arms and wings! He joins the party (for now). They explore East through a secret door and find a training room--a Sugathi worm is overseeing a Destrechan in a pit. A fight breaks out. The Destrechan screams at the party deafening and stunning them. They pull through though and are able to kill both enemies with the help of Murchen.

Through another secret door in the North, they find a large cavern with an underground lake. They begin to explore and as they are crossing an elevated walkway over the lake, they are attacked by a strange watery devil.
