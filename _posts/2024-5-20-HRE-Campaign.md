**10/30/1631 -- 11/01/1631**:

- A mighty blow was dealt to the Cult of Joz-Quatl! The Wolfguard bested the Under-Cleric and the remaining Acolyte. Sadly, heroic Streng perished in the battle. The survivors secured the ground level of the Cloister and recovered several valuable carpets, tapestries, and a three-volume Latin series on architecture and geometry.

- After a night's rest, the Wolfguard returned to confront the rest of the Cult. They descended to the Lower Temple via a secret winding staircase. Cr√∂de, invisibly, snuck into the main room and found another Under-Cleric was preaching to a group of zombies. A crack shot from his trusty crossbow Gertrude hit the Cleric in his gut. Before anything else could happen, Mad Tim ensorceled the Cleric and extracted useful information: the Abbot Grosso has left the Cloister to exact revenge on the Wolfguard, putting devious plans into motion. The party dispatched the Under-Cleric and the remaining zombies. 

- To the North, in dark cells, the find a group of prisoners: Six villagers and several adventurers: Bithan of Un and his cousin Xor of Un, Morton the Elf (also know as The Hand, infamous for forgery and thievery), Frederic and Carolus, and Vilis of Mil (a roguish Greek woman). Before freeing the prisoners, the Wolfguard had to deal with a foul Ogre. A well-timed sleep spell from Sid saved Authlbert from a deadly attack with the Ogre's meat hook.

- Magnus and Authlbert destroy the frog god's soapstone idols and sanctify both levels of the temple. As far as they can tell, no Acolytes are left on the premises. The Under-Cleric mentioned several crypts that house the former Abbots, full of treasure. He also intimated the existence of another, deeper temple below...

- Treasure: 1 potion of gaseous form (100 gp to identify), 3 unholy water potions (10 gp each), 2x carpets (200 gp each), 4 tapestries (300 gp each), 3,500 gp for valuable books. Enough equipment and raw materials to build a full alchemical laboratory.
