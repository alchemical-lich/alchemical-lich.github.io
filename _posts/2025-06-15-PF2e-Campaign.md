**10-11 Gozren 4721**: The Laboratory

The party kills the strange water devil and explores further North. In a deep pond, they spy two sleeping hyrdas. They carefully navigate past them but nearly wake the beasts. They find their way back into the laboratory area and encounter another Seugathi who tries to lure them to its master: Jafaki. The heroes see through the ruse and kill the strange worm. Depleted and exhausted, they decide to return to the surface for the day. 

The next morning, Arryn tutors Dorianna Menhemes on the topic of Nethys. He notices how tired she is. After some probing questions, he learns that Dorianna goes on many adventures with the Motley Man in her dreams. He brings her gifts, including her favorite stuffed animal. Arryn secretly investigates the little toy and finds a ruby sown inside. He also notices that the other kids don't want to play with Dorianna anymore--she is acting strangely around them and constantly talks to her "friend".

The party returns to the dungeon and explores the laboratory area. They skirt around some oozes and find a powerful Irnakuse to the South. The beast proves too powerful for them and the party flees.
