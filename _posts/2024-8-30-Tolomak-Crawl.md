**Day 9-10 on the Tolomak Isles**

Hark! The heroes have vanquished Master Zagarius! After parting ways with the Sea Queen, the party traveled to Eloiz to bring her the good news of her sister's rescue. Margerite staid behind to recuperate from her spell burning. 

The party made it without too much trouble to Eloiz' tower. The Green Lady was joyous to hear the good news and pledged her support to the party's plan: rid the island of Master Zagarius and his devilish scheme. She suggested to seek the aid of Gormaz the Giant Ape. They traveled to the mountain on the Eastern side of the island, where he lairs. They presented an offering and attracted Gormaz attention. The giant beasts climbed down from the mountain and revealed himself to be a former war leader and general, trying to get of the island. He offered his help, in exchange for passage off the island. The heroes agreed. They conconcted a ruse to infiltrate Master Zagarius' fort: Gormaz would pretend to have been captured by the heroes, who would guide him to the beach fort; when close, they would strike and overpower Zagarius and his henchmen.

The plan worked as planned--mostly. Zagarius was indeed surprised as Gormaz broke his rigged constraints and destroyed the fort's guard tower. The heroes swarmed Zagarius and the bodyguard Quorin of the Isles. Zagarius used his Ring of Invisibility to vanish, right after calling on a powerful Djinn to protect him. Quorin conjured a magical shield and three mirror images. It was all in vain though. The combined powers of Totino, Luka, Colin, and Obiwan Cannoli overcome their defense and both Zagarius and Quorin were cut down. What a glorious victory!

The heroes took control of the camp and prepared for their departure from the Tolomak Isles.
