**9/25/1631**:
- Myreg's brush with the shadow leaves lasting scars on the poor boy. He retires from adventuring life and becomes the Company's quartermaster. 
- The party returns to the third level of the Catacombs. Sid has learned the arcane secrets of the Read Magic spell. She uses it to decipher the epitaph on Wygga's Tomb. The crooked sigils contain the secret of a dark summoning spell...
- The party proceeds to an undiscovered part of the Catacombs. To the west of the entrance area, Darvan scouts ahead and finds a room with a chess pattern floor. Four petrified spiders, standing still on the board like chess pieces, come alive and go after him. At the last second, Gerenscer is able to pull Darvan out of the hallway to safety.
- The group proceeds North. They find a room with wall paintings and a ceiling grate. Darvan unlocks the grate and finds a mysterious glass bottle full of blue smoke. Behind the wall paintings, grave niches are hidden. One contains an old piece of parchment, suggesting the bottle imprisons a jinn. Another wall niche triggers a trap of magical darkness. The group flees to the North and is immediately ambushed by a large spider!
- Further North, they find a room with a magically sealed lattice door. A statue of a woman with frog-like features indicates the way to open the gate: bless your hand in the dark waters in the stone bowl. Does this have anything to do with the cult of Joz'Quatl?The new torchbearer Yohann is brave enough to do it and opens the gate.
- To the West, they find more spiders. The light of a torch seems to making them come alive. Darvan is swarmed by spiders and would have died, if it not were for Sid commanding the jinn to save his life. Sid, having cast Sleep on the spiders, cuts them to pieces before they wake. 
- North of the spiders' room, a robbed tomb and a sealed door. Yohann breaks down the door, which is protected by a curse rune, without any trouble. Does he have the blessings of Fortuna?
- The sealed tomb contains a glass coffin, a headless statue, and an iron chest. Darvan, true to his name, nimbly unlocks the chest and solves the puzzle of the glass tomb--yet the skull inside the sarcophagus animates, looking to reap the souls of the living. Darvan, making good use of Wygga's robe, distracts the skull and absconds with three bowls full of gems. They close the door and lock the skull inside. A curious dwarven statuette remains in the glass sarcophagus.
- Before retreating back to safety, Gerenscer saunters down a dark corridor and accidentally triggers a blade trap. Cut down within seconds, he bleeds out in front of Darvan and Sid. 'Tis a cruel place. 
- The party returns Gerenscer's dead body to the surface and inducts Yohann into the Company. The lad seems to have a good head on his shoulders and is unafraid of the catacombs.
- Treasure recovered: 2,100 gp in gems, a gold nugget (50 gp), a glass bottle with a jinn (released), and the Summon spell from Wygga's Tomb.
