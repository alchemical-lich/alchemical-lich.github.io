**Day 5 on the Tolomak Isles -- Continued**
The party puhses deeper into the wizard Shadankin's Sanctum. Further down a damp hallway, they happen upon a nest of six lampreymen. While Colin Robinson prepares a defensive slash with his katana, Tottino the Toothless surges forward by himself into the midst of the eel-creatures. He is swarmed by four of the beast, two attaching their round, toothy mouths to his body. Loud sucking sounds echo through the cavern. A wild melee ensues to save Tottino. Luka Donic, sneaking between fishes hanging from the ceiling, attacks form the shadows and dispatches two lampreymen. Margerita rushes to attack with her elven sword, but stumbles on the slippery floor and breaks her sword.

In the end, the group is able to save Tottino, who was teetering on the brink of collapse, but Obi Wan Cannoli was hurt and fell unconscious in the process. Colin Robinson has to apply one of his valuable healing potions to save her.

The heroes push down a set of crude stairs and find an abandoned wizard's study. Moldy and broken furniture lies on the ground, but the heroes attention is drawn by an old wall mosaic depicting a wizard approaching a large sea shell containing a strange horn. Tottino discerns the wizard is shown to be covered with a strange aura or bubble. In the corner of the room, Luka finds three sealed barrels. With quick and nimlbe hands, he pries them open and recovers three squishy membranes, floating in brine. They take the strange objects into their possession and proceed.

A tunnel leads the group towards a large lagoon, at the bottom of which, covered by 20 ft of sea water, a large sea shells beckons. Obi Wan, Luka, and Colin don the membranes and descend into the water, while Margerita and Tottino keep watch from a ledge. The membranes seem to provide the three with a protective air bubble. They slowly paddle towards the shell and prepare to pry it open with crowbars.

Suddenly, a large, black hammerhead shark cuts through the salty seawater and attacks Colin. Colin and Obi-Wan battle the beast, while Luka continues to prod the shell. A dangerous underwater fight ensues--Colin is bitten by the shark, tearing of a pound of dwarf flesh. Margerita and Tottino, standing upon the ledge, call upon their patrons for aid! Both are heard--and dark powers descend upon the lagoon. Hekhandhoda's vile presence infects the shark with a fever, burning its insides and pushing it into delirium. Dzzali ensorcels the shark further, making Margerita the object of its affection. But the power of patrons is a dangerous thing. Dzzali's magic comes at a price--Colin Robinson, who was in an honorable fight with the beast, is overcome with intense jealousy for Margerita drawing the attention of the shark. Will this sow the seeds of discord in the group? The mercurial Dzzali certainly would enjoy such a thing...

With the help of the dark patrons' intervention, the group overcomes the shark. Luka pries open the shell and finds the mother-of-pearl *Horn of Tudines*, a treasure of great renown. Blasting the horn on open sea, they conjure a mighty sea turtle from the depth of the ocean. On its back, a strange contraption, appearing to be an entrance to the turtle's carapace. Have they found Shadankin's secret vault?
