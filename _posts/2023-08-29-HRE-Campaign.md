**9/22/1631**: The party delved into Level 4 of the catacombs. They found some sarcophagi with valuables, had to kill a chained up prisoner (?). Explored north and found a collapsed floor, retrieved a treasure map from a dead adventurer. Also found a hidden sarcophagus under the collapsed floor (unopened) and a locked bronze door.

On the Western side, they found a group of cannibals. They led them to their leader, Valentin Stelzer. Stelzer came across as slightly crazy, openly talked about cannibalism, mentioned "The Great Questioner" below--how he cleanses souls and supplies them with meat. "He will rise soon and rule Bruckstadt!". Valentin offered passage to the level below via an elevator.

The group was able to retreat from the cannibals, but pissed off their leader in defying his commands.

They retrieved a total of 32 gp but found a way to a lower level of the catacombs.
