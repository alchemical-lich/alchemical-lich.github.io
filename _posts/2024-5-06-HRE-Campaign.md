**10/29/1631 -- 10/31/1631**:

- The Wolfguard sets out to return to Moorbach. On the Wetterstrasse, they encounter a group of downtrodden highwaymen. Authlbert hails them and heals their wounds. They share reports of escalating banditry to the North around the town of Menz.

- In Moorbach, they learn more about the assault from a few nights ago. Green-clad bandits descended on the town, targeting visitors in the Golden Goose. They abducted 18 people and killed 7 villagers. 

- The Wolfguard travels through the swamp, evading some giant leeches, and hatches a plan for their assault on the cloister. Streng, the Halfling thief, is made in invisible and scouts the building.

- At dusk, Streng is sent back in to open the main doors from the inside, while the rest of the party waits outside for a frontal assault.

- Streng is successful and combat begins. The Under-Cleric in the Temple calls on the powers of Joz-Quatl and paralyzes Magnus at the doorstep while the others surge inside. A tense battle ensues. Authlbert is silenced but is able to strike several of the Acolytes and Zombies down, Sid puts three Acolytes to sleep, while Streng traverses the temple under the cloak of invisibility. The fate of the party hangs in the balance as reinforcements arrive and Mad Tim is also paralyzed by a second Under-Cleric. Streng lands a backstab on the foul priest but is in turn struck down by the cleric's mighty flail. Will the Wolfguard prevail?
