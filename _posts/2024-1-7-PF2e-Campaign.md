**3 Pharast 4721**: Exploring the Gauntlight

- After a night's rest and some research at the Dawnflower Library the group returns to the Gauntlight Ruins. Last night at dinner, they met Carman Rajani, the local blacksmith. He has a low opinion of the mayor Menhemes, accusing him of ignoring the well-being of the regular townsfolk. He also heard the rumor that Menhemes is running a secret logging camp with kobolds. It is hard to know how much to trust the tales of Rajani, given his penchant for drinking.

- The party explores the Southwestern tower of the ruins and slays two giant flies.

- To the North, they find a room haunted by a group of kobold ghosts. The joint prayers of Arryn and Corbin's diplomatic efforts appease the ghosts. They recover the buried kobold bones and afford them a proper burial.

- Off from the main hall, they find a secret room that contains a destroyed teleportation circle. Wherever did it lead?

- They push to the North and enter the room right under the copula. They find a strange pool of fresh blood and a iron stair case leading upward. Zgaaz insists the blood must have come from the Mitflits, but the others suspect something strange is afoot.
