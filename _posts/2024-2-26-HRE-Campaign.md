**10/01/1631 -- 10/02/1631**:

- After having slain the giant Eunuch, the group secures the main building. Cromby, with the help of Sid and Cr√∂de, carefully explores the upper level. They secure some treasure and find the bandit leaders' chache of gold.

- In the attic, a strange Chinese urn is discovered among some bat guano.

- The group moves to secure the keep tower in the Southwest of the Castle Ruin. Inside, two remaining bandits surprise Cromby. A pistol shot hits him in the chest and he collapses to the floor. Zelphar has to pour a healing potion down his throat to safe him. After dispatching the remaining bandits, the party discovers a stone slab, covered under rubble, barring access to a level below the ruin. A strange cold emanates from the stone.

- The group interrogates the captured bandits. Apparently, Jeka Garcia moved them into the Castle several weeks ago to prepare an attack on Bruckstadt. Making a deal with one of the bandits for more information, they learn that Jeka has personal history with a man named Cardozo in Bruckstadt. She was also very interested in finding a book in the ruins of Castle Aarhorst. The party furthermore learns that Garcia can speak with ghosts and has more bandit allies in the region. Certainly not someone to be trifled with!

- The bandit also reveals that a scaly beast dwells in the well. Every night, the bandits throw food down the well to keep the creature from emerging. The group does the same to secure a night's rest.

- The next day, the group returns to Bruckstadt to deliver the remaining the bandits to justice (and for a reward of 75 gp!). They purchase supplies, ask Cafarelli to identify the discovered magic items, and hire a small band of mercenaries and specialists to guad teh Castle Ruins (5 light footmen at 20 gp per month, 5 archers at 50 gp per month, a cook at 10 gp per month, and a blacksmith at 25 gp per month).

- The return to Castle Aarhorst the same day and lay a trap for the beast: burying a large bear trap next to the well and tying a goat to the tree nearby as bait. When the creature emerges in the middle of the night, the crew is ready to fire from the safety of the arrow slits. The beast crawls out of the well, towards the goat. The trap springs and catches the right front leg of the beast. The party rains ranged attacks on the beast and Authlbert charges into melee. The beast roars and sets its gaze upon the cleric, paralyzing him mid-swing. Lcukily, Sid casts sleep on the creature and the group can safely kill the beast before it kills Authlbert.
