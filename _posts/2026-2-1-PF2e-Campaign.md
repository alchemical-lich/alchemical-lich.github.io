**14-15 Gozren 4721**: The Prison

The heroes explore the prison level further. They discover an imprisoned Gug--their attempt to communicate though quickly devolves into a fight.

Further North, they find a summoning chamber, guarded by a Bone Devil and two Erynis. A brutal fight ensues, but quick thinking by the heroes, paired with a bit of luck, swings the battle in their favor.

On the dead bodies of one of the Erynis, they find the final piece of the pentagram amulet.
