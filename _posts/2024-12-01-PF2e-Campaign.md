**1 Gozren 4721**: The Library

- Corbin rests to deal with his ghoul fever.

- Upon return to the Library, the group deals with a possessed stove and a Gibbering Mouther.

- They descend further below and find a dining room with several Corpselights. During the fight, Volluk Azrinae and a Scalathrax join to threaten the party's survival--but the combined might of their weapons and magics fells the strange worm man and his spidery pet.
