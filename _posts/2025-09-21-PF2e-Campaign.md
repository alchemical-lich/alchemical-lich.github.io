**13-14 Gozren 4721**: Otari Under Attack

The party defeats the devils and rescues Vandy. Several citizens perished in the attack, including Oloria Gallatine.

Morlibint, of *Odd Stories*, is nowhere to be found. The heroes help the next day re-organize the town and reassure the local population.

Curiously, mayor Menhemes is not seen in town. In the afternoon, they visit the mayor's manor and find him hiding with his family.

Apparently, during the night, Dorianna acted strangely and the house began shaking. They hid from her and waited out the night.

When questioned, Dorianna explains that she went on an adventure with the Motley Man--they hunted for a hare. Her hand is all withered and black because she "gifted" it to him.

They find another red ruby in her stuffed griffin animal and are able to determine that a Denizen of Leng is preying on her.
