**28 Pharast 4721**: Maunder Bridge and the Lumber Camp

- Facing the vicious gargoyle, the party battered and bruised, but victorious. They quickly patched the wounds and began to explore Maunder Castle.

- Inside, they found one of the dwarven brother, Morgrym Leadbuster, immersed in a dark ritual. They busted through the door and confronted him and his skeletal servitors. After a short battle, they discovered a series of letters, instructing the dwarven brothers to sabotage the lumber business of Oseph Menhemes. The letters were signed with the name of "Auldegrund Grimcarver". They also learned that the two remaining brothers were on their way to attack the kobold lumber camp

- They rushed through the forest and arrived just in time. The two dwarfs and their three hellhounds had set the camp ablaze and were surrounding a group of brave kobold fighters when the heroes arrived. The kobolds sustained heavy losses in the battle, but powerful attacks by Rizzard ended the hellhound threat quickly, while the others dealt with the dwarven saboteurs. 

- Upon returning to Otari, the party was rewarded by Oseph, as promised, but not without some unwarranted criticism of their failure to fully protect the kobold camp. Nonetheless, it was enough to purchase a magical rune for Rizzard's armor, providing him with a bit of extra protection.
