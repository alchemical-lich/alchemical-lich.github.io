**11/05/1631--11/17/1631**:


- The Wolfguard steps through the portal and finds itself in a secret, magical garden. After solving a chess puzzle, they enter a hallway--the Path of Knightly Virtue. Cr√∂de, moving like the Knight chess piece, traverses the hallway without being attacked by two grim Iron Knights. On the other side, they find the Knight Rossbert that is guarding the 12 magical chalices and the fountain of St. Maria. The Wolfguard learns they can take one chalice with the holy water, but no more. They have to wait another year and return if they want more. 

- Removing one chalice, they return to the Abbey and plan to confront the Abbot. An attempt to lure the Abbot out of his sepulcher fails, but Magnus is able to surprise the Abbot by drawing his attention to the chalice. Spraying him with holy water, the others close in and attack. A tense battle ensues in which Sid and Magnus are drained of their life energy. In the end, the party prevails, but at what cost?

- They are rewarded with a magical ring by St. Maria for freeing the Abbey of Abbot Guillaume. They make their way down the mountain and encounter a Treant. Gaspard, with his elvish sensibilities, is able to treat with the tree creature and win its favor by gifting it a healing potion. The Wolfguard receives the Treant's protection.

- They return to their Keep and Bruckstadt to tend to some business. They decline to bring the holy water to Pastor Ludwig von Acht. Instead, they use it to restore Sid's life energy. They pick up some additional rumors in town: Mentzer's Irregulars, a famous mercenary company, has a new captain: Jeka Garcia. Apparently, she is hiring men all over the region. The magistrate of Metz is calling for help. 20,000 gp for the brave soul that can apprehend the bandit Christman Grippertenius--dead or alive. The Wolfguard is also offered 2,000 go to attend a secret meeting with one Theodor Franzwein. They are to meet him in Bruckstadt in three days time, at midnight in the graveyard.

- Treasure value recovered: 4,163 GP total
- Magic items: Potion of Gaseous Form, Potion of Flying, Silvered staff +1, Ring of Protection +1, Spell Book (Light, Read Magic, Knock, Invisibility 10ft)
