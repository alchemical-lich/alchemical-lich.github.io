**9/20/1631**: The PCs go to a deeper level of the catacombs, finding sealed tombs of members of the Carr family, some of which are protected by ancient magical runes.

They recover a fragment of a Wolf Head amulet from the tomb of Perewin Carr. In the same chamber, the PCs recover another book, bound in human skin and written in Latin.

The PCs had to deal with a corpse, animated by blood-drinking roots.
One of the PCs steps on a curse rune, ages and de-ages several years within the span of seconds, and dies.

They break open another burial chamber and find the Tomb of Wygga. On the tomb stone, there is a spell inscribed (unidentified). They also recover a magical robe.  IDENTIFY DONE: The damp robe acts like a Invisibility to Unde- ad spell, making the wearer invisible to the undead. Each round that he is invisible, the wearer loses one point of Constitution until it is reduced to 9 points. Then the effect of the spell ends.

They also find a family grave, protected by a set of wooden statues. After smashing the statues, they recover treasure and a magical chain.

They find a passage to another part of the catacombs that lies between the first and their current level.


The other group continues their exploration of the Keudel's Mausoleum. Treasure is recovered and two strange slimes are destroyed, the brave Yosenfef dies.

They make it to a room with a large frog idol but don't have the time to fully search everything. A locked door remains untouched.
