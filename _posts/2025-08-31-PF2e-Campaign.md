**12 Gozren 4721**: The Laboratory

The party explores the rest of the laboratory level and prepares for the confrontation with Jafaki. After a rest, they return to the Abomination Vaults and attack Jafaki. The vile worm is protected by a Drider and a transformed Murshen, fashioned into a Flesh Golem with parts from several Morlocks. Will our heroes survive?
