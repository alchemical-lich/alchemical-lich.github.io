**10/13/1631 -- 10/14/1631**:

- The Wolfguard re-groups in Moorbach after the last delve.  

- Mad Tim, Authlbert, Magnus, Sid, Cröde, Zelphas, Cromby, and the men-at-arms Pox make plans to return to the Cloister. They make their way through the swamp without issue, following their established route. They approach the Cloister's island through the cover of the morning fog and hide their canoes in one of the caves. 

- Their first goal is the retrieve the valuable metal pan flutes in one of the upper crypts. Cromby, Mad Tim, and Cröde stop their ears with old candle wax to avoid ensorcelement by the music and sneak up the stairs. The others lay in waiting the level below. Cromby pries out the flutes with a crowbar. While the wax protects them from the magical melodies of the flute, it also hinders them from hearing the approaching footsteps. From another set of stairs, a horde of ten zombies emerges and swarms them. A wild battle ensues that nearly ends in calamity, but the heroes prevail. 

- They begin to explore Eastward, finding more and more crypts for the green-robed priests. They discover "THE GRAVES OF THE LOWER PRIESTHOOD" and find a small statuette with a golden diadem. As Cromby snatches the valuable object, a croaking sounds echoes through the hall and six blackened undead emerge with unnatural speed. Only a holy prayer by Magnus saves the group from certain death. They block the Southern passage to bar the undead from returning. 

- Further East, they fund a secret door. Cromby quietly swings the heavy stone door open and peeks into the chamber: They found the inner sanctum of Joz-Quatl. A large hall of worship, an evil altar with a road idol, a large collection of valuable ceremonial oils and greases. A large cauldron bubbles in the center of the hall, emitting a vile stench. Eight zombies stand on the far side of the room, as if in contemplation and prayer. 

- The group makes a plan to lure the zombies towards their narrow hallway. Things go according to plan and they are able to destroy or turn all of the foes. The Wolfguard starts to claim their treasure. As they grab the ceremonial oils and Magnus pries two emeralds out of the toad idols eyes, Sid keeps an eye (and ear) to the door to the South. Suddenly, the door springs open and Abbot Grosso, a fat, toad-like man in ceremonial robes and a wicked flail in his hand, emerges. Accompanied by eight more zombies, the Abbot confronts the Wolfguard. 

- In the chaotic back and forth, the Abbot's attempts to cast his dark magics are foiled by several successful strikes. Mad Tim and Zelphar send eldritch energies to blast the evil cleric, while the zombies swarm into their midst. Sid goes down in the melee with the undead, while Abbot Grosso smashes his fail in anger into Cröde's head--who collapses in a pool of blood. Severely injured, the Abbot turns and flees upstairs to rally his allies. 

- The group rushes to save the lives of Sid and Cröde and absconds with as much treasure as they can carry. Rushing through the catacombs and caverns, they make it to their canoes, paddling with all their might. It seems as if the swamp has come alive, the croaking of the frogs and buzzing of mosquitoes revealing their position in the fog to the pursuing acolytes of Joz-Quatl. After hours of pursuit, the party is able to lose their crazed toad-worshippers in the swamp, and make to back to the safety of Moorbach!


- Treasure recovered: Treasure: 1 gold diadem (700gp), pan flute (2400gp), ceremonial oils and greases (6000gp), two (cursed) emeralds (7000 gp each), 10 acid flasks, 1 vial of unholy water (3 doses), 2 unopened and warded chests.
