**07/05/2008**:

- H Cell has been dispatched to Yosemite National Park for OPERATION FULMINATE.

- The Team (Kreese, Krause, Seans) arrives at the Racnhero Falls Trailhead Ranger Station and begins questioning BRANDON MCGILL. They discover strange scars on his body and a suspicious tattoo on his neck.

- They investigate Brandon's disappearance, his report of tall strangers, a deep cave, and two other kids. They find suggestive evidence children have been going missing in Yosemite since at least 1914.

- Hikers report tall strangers creeping in the woods. The team investigates and finds unusual tracks in the woods. Someone also cut the tires to their SUV.

- The agents attempt to extract an object embedded under Brandon McGill's tattoo but he displays unnatural regenerative abilities. Brandon also seems to have telekinetic powers.

- Brandon's parents arrive from the airport as the storm intensifies. The agents do their best to keep Brandon separated from his parents.

- Suddenly, at the main door, another Brandon McGill appears.
