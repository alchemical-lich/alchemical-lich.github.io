**Session 1 Music of the Spheres of Chaos**

After returning from the Tolomak Isles, the party rests and recuperates in Punjar. Spending their well earned money, they enjoy a bit of downtime. Totino sequesters himself and works on creating a Wizard's Staff. He adorns a piece of oak with all the strange teeth he has collected over the years. Sacrificing a bit of himself, he empowers the staff with arcane force.

Luke discovered that in one of Master Zagarios' strong boxes, a false bottom hid a strange piece of vellum. He suggests a meeting in one of their favorite Punjar taverns. 

After a bit of food and drink, the pour over the vellum. Totino discern that this could be a Sheaf of Chaos, a cryptic piece of writing associated with the mysterious cult of the Theophages--the God-Eaters. Colin sees that the ink has made from a rare ore, only found in some remote mountain ranges. Obi-Wan notices that the vellum is made from the skin of a rare snow cat. These two leads point to the distant mountain of Sagar-Matha, the highest peak in the lands. Totino also remembers that the Theophages used a code that involved folding their writings in a specific way...

As the party is beginning to decipher the secret message, dark shadows cover the doors and windows of the tavern. Black smoke emanates from the fire place and patrons closest to the shadows begin to fall asleep. A group of thirteen black-clad assassins emerges from the smoke, followed by a wizard of sorts. The dark-robed leader has spindly arms with spidery fingers on his hands, his robe stretching over his beer belly. He demands the party hands over the Sheave of Chaos, but they refuse. The assassins swarm the group! Within seconds they are in trouble. Everyone is injured and Obi-Wan loses consciousness. Colin has to step in front of the party and draw the assassins' attacks. As the black magician begins to intone a spell, Totino call on his patron Hekanhoda--and the strange being responds! The magician begins to writhe in pain as a tumorous growth bursts out of his chest, spraying black blood and gore everywhere. The man collapses to the ground, dead before his foul spell could be completed. The assassins though are crazed fanatics and continue to swarm. Margerita, Luka, and Colin cut down a few but the situation remains dire. Totino begs for Hekanhoda's help again and the shadows on the walls turn green, wafting toward the assassins. The green mists fill the lungs of the assassins. They begin to choke and fall to the ground. The party takes advantage of the situation and finishes them off.

The party decides to leave Punjar and head to the mountain of Sagar-Matha. They gather their gear and head out. The journey is long and arduous. After two months of travel, they reach a plateau close to the peak of Sagar-Matha. In the distance, they spy the ruins of an old monastery as cold winds whip around them...
