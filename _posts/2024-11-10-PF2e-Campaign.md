**29 Pharast 4721**: The Library

- The party restocks on supplies in Otari, while Corbin let's his wounds be tended by Worliwynn. He spends the night at her tent by the pond...

- The heroes return to the Library level under Gauntlight Keep. On their way, they spot more and more spider webs in the second level. Down on the third, their acquaintance Augreal is nowhere to be found...

- They find the double doors to the Restricted Area of the Library barred. The canker ghouls seemingly retreated to the other side of the barrier.

- They venture North, to another part of the library. They enter a small room full of book cases and a small miniature model of the city of Absalom. On the far side, a large wooden statue looms. Before they can investigate in depth, the statue begins to move. Corbin surmises this to be a Wood Golem--a terrifying artificial creature of great power but with a notable weakness for magical fire. A tense battle ensues and heroes have to retreat back into the hallway, barely escaping with their lives.

- They patch their wounds and formulate a plan. Before they can act, they are surprised from the South by a terrifying sight. A man-shaped mass of worms and leeches approaches and demands to know what they are doing in "his" domain. Arryn is sure--this must be Volluk Azrinae, the former assistant of Belcorra Haruvex. Volluk approaches and begins to weave his magic. The heroes react quickly and swarm the him. He protects himself with defense magics, and retreating with a teleport spell. Before the party can close in, he dissolves into a mass of worms and vanishes into cracks in the floor. 

- The party is left to lick their wounds and plan their next move. They are sure that Volluk will return, and they must be ready for him. For now, they decide to destroy the Wood Golem lingering in the room down the hallway. They formulate a plan to attack from outside the room. They are successful, albeit at a terrible price. The Golem hurls four sharp wood splinters at Rizzard, critically wounding him. Blood gushes and covers the walls. Rizzard collapses to the floor, lifelessly. Zazgaz fells the creature with a mighty blow if his Guisarme. Inside the room, they recover valuable books, but that is all they find. 

- They retreat back to the surface with the body of their fallen comrade.
