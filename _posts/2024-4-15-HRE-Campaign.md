**10/9/1631 -- 10/12/1631**:

- The Wolfguard spends some time in town preparing for their next excursion. Sid and Mad Tim transcribe new spells into their grimoires. Mad Tim learns how to identify magic items and applies his new ability: the brass sphere they found under the Cloister is a Pearl of Power!

- Mad Tim, Magnus, Crüde, Zelphas, Cromby, and the men-at-arms Pox and Anzor set out to the Cloister. On the way through the swamp, they encounter six killer frogs. After some ineffective ranged attacks, they decide to evade the creatures. Relying on their canoes, they make a quick escape.

- Back at the Cloister, they return to the caves below, stowing their canoes out of sight. Exploring Eastward, they find a shabby, wooden barricade, blocking a passage. Turning West, back to the cave with the strange glass slabs, they get rushed by a horde of skeletons. A tense battle ensues. With the help of Magnus' holy symbol and deadly shots by Cromby, the group is able to return the skeletons to death. A total of 22 enemies! The battle drained the party though--Crüde only survived with the timely intervention of Magnus, while their hireling Anzor perished.

- Having nothing to show for their hard labors, the group decides to explore just a bit further. Cromby sneaks up a set of stairs and finds a crypt with a goat-man statues, holding a set of metal pan-pipes. A wind, blowing through the hall, makes the pipes emit a strangely melodic sound. Cromby approaches and is ensorceled by the music. He begins to dance the Tarantella as several goat-man skeletons joins. He twirls through the hall, faster and faster, nearly collapsing, as he is finally able to tear himself away and flee down the stairs.

- Down below and to the East, the group discovers more passageways. Behind a secret door lies a moldy tunnel. To the Northeast, more hallways and crypts. Is there any treasure to be found? The group decides to flee the caves for now and return at full strength.

- Treasure recovered: 0gp.
