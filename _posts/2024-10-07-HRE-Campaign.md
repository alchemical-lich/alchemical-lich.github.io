**12/08/1631 -- 12/14/1631**:

- The Scouts of the Wolfguard set out North to explore the mountains to the East and the Bergkessel region to the North.

- The travel several days North, hugging the mountains around the Brocken--the highest peak in the region and a place best avoided. Locals speak in hushed tones of the mountain and make warding signs when asked.

- They spot a tower in the distance and travel towards it. On their way, they encounter a group of five men. They wear distinctive green cloaks, carry longbows and spears, and seem to move with expertise through the undergrowth. The men warn them off of the tower and encourage the group to travel elsewhere. One of the scouts remembers hearing stories of the Greencloak Pikes, a deserter regiment of elite scouts from Prince Waldrecht's host. Maybe these men belong to the deserters?

- The party camps down for the night and is surprised when a hooded figure approaches the camp, accompanied by the Greencloak Pikes frome earlier in the day. The hooded man demands a tribute: one of the Wolfguard needs to come with him to guarantee safe passage for the others. The party refuses and a battle breaks out. 

- The Greencloak Pikes are skilled fighters, and the hooded man seems to be a wizard of some sort. The party is outmatched and three of the scouts are killed (Balm, Roscoe, and Meister Fritz). The party flees into the night.

- They regroup at Bruckstadt and set out on a Southeastern route, circumventing the mountains and heading towards Tour-en-Savoy. They travel for several days and encounter a giant rooster on the way. 

- In Tour-en-Savoy, they sleep the night at the Tap, a disreputable tavern and guesthouse. 

- The next day, they begin exploring the ruins of Castle Xyntillan. The castle is in ruins, but the courtyard is still intact, albeit abandoned. The party is attacked by skeletons and a strange vampiric cloud. Grimnar is knocked unconscious by the soporific smells of a rose garden and falls down a parapet, hitting his head.
