**9/24/1631**:

- The party returns to the fourth level of the Catacombs to plunder the remaining tombs.

- They open the sarcophagus of Frendel II and a dark shadow attacks. Myreg is struck and an unnatural cold envelopes him. He falls unconscious, his soul slipping away. Darvan, equipped with Wygga's robe and the Deadwood Sword, slays the nightmare. The party retreats, carrying the dying Myreg and the old crown of the Carr family (worth 1,800 gp).

- They also retrieve five gold cups worth a total of 2,000gp from the acid bath in the tomb of Frendel II.

- In the king's sarcophagus, they find the third piece of the Wolf's Head Amulet. Scribe Cafarelli helps them assemble the magical amulet, which provides protection.

- The sarcophagus was filled with a grey sludge, containing four shiny pearls. Cafarelli thinks this is a substance called **Toad Glass**.  Cultists of Joz'Quatl claim the consumption of Toad Glass has positive effects...

- Cafarelli has a contact in Nordhausen, a city to the West, that might be interested in fencing the crown of the Carr family.
