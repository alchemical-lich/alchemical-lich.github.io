Another group belonging to the mercenary company arrives in Bruckstadt. They are pursuing a rumor about a golden toad idol hidden in the family crypt of the Keudel family.

The PCs break into the Keudel's mausoleum in Bruckstadt's graveyard. They encounter a gang of three grave robbers (led by the woman Stine) but make a mutually beneficial deal with them. They pay her 50gp for safe passage and her gang will protect the group's exit. Any future delves only cost 10gp.
The PCs encounter petrified spiders and a hidden passage to a much older part of the mausoleum, adorned with strange frog statues.
