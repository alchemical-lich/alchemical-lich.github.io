**12/03/1631 -- 12/04/1631**:

- The Archbishop Franz von Hatzfeld has been kidnapped! The Wolfguard devised a shrewd plan: to poison the Archbishop's wine with a potion of Gaseous Form and suck his airy essence into a bottle.

- They acquired a bellows and bottle to execute their plan and spread rumors of a wine merchant, Maurice from the East, who has a special vintage for sale. Mad Tim accelerated the plan by Charming the Archbishop's butler, Hubert. Through Hubert, they scored an invitation to the Archbishop's dinner to present a wine tasting.The night before the dinner, they sabotage the river chains at the Southern bridge.

- The next day, Wilhelm and Gaspard take position on the river, posing as fishermen, ready to catch the thrown bottle. The others, posing as attendants of the wine merchant, are led to the dinner. The Archbishop is dining in a beautiful gallery, accompanied by Father Oswald and two Schwarzritter Guards.

- Sid, after presenting an initial taste of real wine, hands the Archbishop a cup filled with the potion of Gaseous Form. The Arhcbishop takes a deep draw and begins to transform. At that moment, Sid and Mad Tim attempt to cast spells on the guards, but they react too quickly to be surprised. Mad Tim's spell is disrupted, but Sid is able to put Father Oswald, Hubert the Butler, and one Schwarzritter to sleep. Pox begins using the bellows to suck up the Archbishop and transfer him into a bottle. 

- The others begin battling the remaining Schwarzritter. Sid quaffs a potion of invisibility and fly, grabbing the bottle with the Archbishop. She flies out of the window and begins to make her escape. The others gather around Mad Tim, who uses a scroll of Invisibility 10ft, and they rush out of the room. The remaining guard yells: "Alarm! Alarm! The Archbishop has been kidnapped!"
