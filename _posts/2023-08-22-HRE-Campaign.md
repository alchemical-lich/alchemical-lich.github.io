**9/21/1631**:

Wolfgang, Tatiana, Myreg, and Authlbert delve into the Roman catacombs. Tatiana sacrifices her life to protect the others from a fire trap. She perishes in the flame gust.

The groups burns poisonous fungus to access undisturbed grave niches. They recover treasure.
They find the tomb of the architect. The wizard Boltan Raureif is looking for the architect's skull. The door is protected by a curse rune.

The find an old chapel, occupied by a family of three cannibals. The father wants the group's help in fixing his organ. They assist (and recover some odd sheet music.

The mothers demands fresh flesh from the party. Violence ensues. The party survives, but Wolfgang receives a gut shot from the little cannibal boy and dies from blood loss.

They sacrifice blood to a toad idol and unlock a passage to a deeper level of the catacombs with a toad finger.

They also recover Father Brin's diary.

Later that day, they returned to town, picked up some pre-ordered plate armor, read the History of the Grenzland, Father Brin's diary, and had Cafarelli identify the Fire Protection Amulet. Cafarelli offered to translate the Book of Raz'Kafaun and provide information on ghosts in exchange for retrieving the book Magic of the Toad from Castle Aarhorst.
