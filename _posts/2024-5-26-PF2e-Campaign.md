**22-24 Pharast 4721**: The Library

- The party takes a rest after the encounter with the Lurker in the Light. They explore around the reading room and discover a set of stairs leading deeper below as well as a well-kept washroom.

- They return to the library hall and head East. They push through a door and encounter a room filled with Ghoul Cultists. The Lurker is also present is is egging the Ghouls on. An extended battle ensues in which Arryn gets severely injured by the rage-filled lurker, but the heroes prevail. Except, one ghoul flees North through a set of double doors and they hear a violent scream. 

- The party decides to retreat before whatever issued the scream emerges from the library.

- On the way out, they spot an unusual amount of spiderwebs on the second level. Certainly nothing to be concerned about.

- Back in Otari, they tend to business. Arryn struggles with his Blue Blister affliction and has to seek the help of Vandy Banderdash. For a generous donation, she calls on the aid of Sarenrae to heal his painful rash.

- Corbin is visited by local merchant Keeleno Lathenar, who warns him off Worliwynn. He seems to have a grduge against the druids of the Stone Circle. He explains that 20 years ago a member of the Circle, Jaul Mesmin, brutally murdered his wife. The druids tried to cover up his crimes. When the villagers confronted him, he jumped off the Otaru cliffs and was never seen again.
