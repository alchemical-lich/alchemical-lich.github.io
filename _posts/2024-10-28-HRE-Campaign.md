**12/18/1631**:

- The Wolfguard returns to Castle Xyntillan. This time, they do not encounter bandits in the courtyard. Their dog barks when passing by the stables and the group decides to investigate. Inside the stables, they encounter a group of skeletons engaged in target practice with a deceased adventurer. The party dispatches the skeletons in a tense battle. They win but not without losing Grimnar. 

- They go venture through the double door and discover a secondary courtyard. They move into the Northern parts of the compound, moving through several rooms. They find some dead bodies and a strange horn that conjures coins. 

- They stumble upon an older woman folding laundry, who takes issue with the party's presence. She gets so angry that she begins to grow fur and her nails begin to elongate. She transforms into a werewolf and attacks the party. The party is able to defeat her but not without Elowen being bitten.

- The party retreats. On their way out, they discover an old bath. They retrieve some valuable perfumes but also run into one Jaumon Malevol the Dreamwright. He asks for a small business loan to the tune of 400 gp to support a new venture of his. He can be found in Tours-en-Savoy for the next three days.
