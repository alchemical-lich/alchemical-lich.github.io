**10 Gozren 4721**: The Arena and the Laboratory

The party decides to return to the dungeon and explore the southern part of the Arena level. They find two dead basilisks amid a heap of skeletons. They push further south and discover a huge arena with a Behemoth Shanrigol.

They make a plan and attack the creature from above. Clever tactics and a bit of luck lead to the quick demise of the beast. They descend to the arena floor and spot a strange work observing them from an observation balcony. Zazgazan flies after the creature and is attacked by two strangely modified Morlocks. The worm, coming out of temporary invisibility, attacks as well but the combined power of the party is too much for the creatures. 

After the fight, they move West into a room with four small cells. Ghasts emerge but the party makes quick work of them.
