**2 Pharast 4721**: Exploring the Gauntlight

- The party circles eastward around the **Gauntlight Ruins**. They make their way across a bit of swampy water to access a collapsed part of the eastern wall. 

- Through the wall, they encounter more Mitflits and a Mudflicker Maggot. The fight with the Gremlins attracts three more Mitflits from a room to the South. The party prevails. They find evidence of a large magical battle that occurred in the L-shaped hall. 

- Pushing forward to the Southeastern part of the ruins, they find a sinkhole with a buried passage to a dungeon level below (currently inaccessible). Through a set of double doors, they encounter an old skeleton in armor. **Rizzard** senses a magical aura nearby: the skeleton is holding a magical morning star! **Corbin** takes possession of the mighty weapon.

- Through another set of double doors, they enter a ramshackle throne room, ruled by one **Boss Skrawng**, the Mitflit leader. He is accompanied by three Mitflits and his pet spider Bite-Bite.

- **Boss Skrawng** seems to be surprised by the heroes arrival. He implies that he hasn't even attacked the town yet, but still preparing his "grand plan"! 

- After an attempt at peaceful resolution, violence ensues. **Boss Skrawng** poisons **Rizzard** and Bite-Bite takes several painful bites out of him. Some timely healing by **Arryn**, **Corbin** crushing a Mitflit skull with his new morningstar, **Zgaz** raging through the enemies, and **Rizzard** unleashing a powerful *Shocking Grasp* with his elven sword, brings a quick end to the gremlins. 

- Before his demise, **Boss Skrawng** was able to obscure parts of his battle plan for Otari, which he had drawn in a small sandbox. Under his throne, the party retrieves a hand-drawn map of the Ruins. Where did the Mitflits come from? What where their plans? There is certainly more to this...

- Exploring a room to the West, **Arryn** investigates the corpse of a giant frog, but is surprised by two more maggots, bursting from its guts. **Rizzard** gets caught in the mandibles of the beasts, but **Corbin**'s morning star has no trouble breaking through the chitinous armor, crushing the soft maggot flesh underneath. **Zgaz** is sure the frog was killed by a draconic creature.

- The party decides to retreat for the day and returns to **Otari** around mid-day.
