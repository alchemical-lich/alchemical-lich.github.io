**2 Pharast 4721**: Exploring the Gauntlight

- The party circles Eastward around the **Gauntlight Ruins**. They make their way across a bit of swampy water to access a collapsed part of the Eastern wall. 

- Through the wall, they encounter more Mitflits and a Mudflicker Maggot. The fight with the Gremlins attracts three more Mitflits from a room to the South. The party prevails. They find evidence of a large magical battle that occurred in the L-shaped hall. 

- Pushing forward to the Southeastern part of the ruins, they find a sinkhole with a buried passage to a dungeon level. Through a set of double doors, they encounter an old skeleton in armor with a magical morning star.

- Through another set of double doors, they enter a ramshackle throne room, ruled by one **Boss Skrawng**, the Mitflit leader. He is accompanied by three Mitflits and his pet spider Bite-Bite.

- **Boss Skrawng** seems to be surprised by the heroes arrival. He implies that he hasn't even attacked the town yet, he is still preparing his "grand plan". 

- After an attempt at peaceful resolution, violence ensues, and the heroes make short order out of the gremlins. 

- **Boss Skrawng** was able to obscure parts of his battle plan for Otari, but the party is able to retrieve a hand-drawn map of the Ruins.

- Exploring a room to the West, **Arryn** investigates a the corpse of a giant frog, but is surprised by two more maggots. **Zgaz** is sure the frog was killed by a draconic creature.

- The party decides to retreat for the day and returns to **Otari** around mid-day.
