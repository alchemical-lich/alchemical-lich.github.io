Here are some thoughts on how to use CY_BORG to play Shadowrun. 

# Setting Details:

- It is the year 2123. The world has gone through dozens of climate disasters, environmental degradation, political revolutions, at least four deadly pandemics, and other calamities.

- The megacity CY arose out of the ruins of Northern Europe. It stretches across what used to be Hamburg in the Southwest, Rostock in the Southeast, to Copenhagen and Malmö in the North, and the rest of former Denmark. Norther Germany, Poland, and the rest of Scandinavia are associated territories full of industrial parks, ag and server farms, smaller commuter cities, and toxic wasteland ruled by Nomad clans.

- 60+ years ago nanotech became all the rage. By now, most biological matter has active and defunct nanobots in their system. 

- Asteroids fell on earth and caused calamities all over. The asteroids carried different strains of alien bacteria that interacted with the nanobot technology and spread. Several of the older bacterial strains caused metatype mutations, other, more recent variants, more horrific changes.


# Character Creation

## Prior Careers
PVNKS start with a failed career that defines their pre-existing skills and knowledge. Make one up, roll on the table below, or look at the NPC Role table on p.116.


| **D20** | Career|
|---------|-------|
| 1 | Backalley Doctor |
| 2 | Disgraced Corporate Drone | 
| 3 | Street Hustler | 
| 4 | Failed Entertainer, Social media influencer|
| 5 | Ganger/low-level criminal|
| 6 | Laid-off programmer | 
| 7 | Failed scientist | 
| 8 | Fraudulent accountant, white collar criminal | 
| 9 | Factory worker |
| 10 | Drug dealer|
| 11 | EMT | 
| 12 | Low-rent bounty hunter   |

# Contacts
Each PVNK starts the game with two level 1 **Contacts** or one level 2 **Contact**. Roll on the NPC table on p.116.

**Level 1 Contacts**- Standard contact. Merely an acquaintance. Level 1 contacts will charge for meaningful inormation and help.

**Level 2 Contacts**- A friend. You have done each other some favors and there is a certain level of trust. DR-2 on any Presence check when attempting to get a Level 2 contact to do something for you. Level 2 contact will not charge for simple things.

**Level 3 Contacts**- A true friend. A rare thing in CY. If a test is needed to convince the contact to help you in some way, you receive Advantage on the Presence roll. Level 3 contacts are predisposed to doing favors for free.





# Advancement
PVNKs in CY_BORG advance in a variety of ways:

1. Between missions via the rules on p.89, improving HP and ability modifiers.

2. Finding or purchasing better gear.

3. Finding or purchasing better cyberware.

4. Finding or purchasing better Apps or Nano-infestations.

5. Training for **Talents**.


## Talents

Adapted from Unheroic Feats in MB Heretic. 

**Talents** can be acquired by PVNKs when improving between missions (see p.89). PVNKS can gain up to three **Talents**. The first costs 10k, the second 25k, the third 50k. 

| **D66**   |**Talent** | **Effect**|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|   11      |    Assassin       |    Test Strength DR12 to grapple an unaware foe and automatically crit with a one-handed bladed weapon or a garotte.      |
|   12      |     Spiritualist      |  Sacrifice 1k to regain a lost Glitch (once per day)        |
|   13      |  Bare-Knuckle Brawler        |  Your unarmed attacks deal d6 damage and ignore light armor. You may take this Feat a second time, increasing to d8 damage, and a third time to d10 damage. If you crit on an attack, you also stun your enemy.  Fumbling an unarmed attack means you break a hand, dealing the damage to yourself. You must seek out a specialist to help you set your bones. |
|   14      |   Spree-Killer        |  When landing an attack that kills a target, you must attack another (this may include allies), adding d6 damage for every creature slain. Your onslaught stops when you fail to kill and you fall to the ground exhausted, losing your next turn.|
|   15      |   Field Medic        |  Test Agility DR12 to return a **Battered** PC to 1 HP.       |
|   16      |  Precision Striker         |  Once per turn, when making a ranged or melee attack, roll damage with advantage. |
|   21      | Expert        |   Pick a technical or academic field of expertise. Checks for your area of expertise have advantage. Can be picked multiple times.       |
|   22      |   Dual Wielder    |  You have trained to fight with two weapons. Roll both damage dice and keep the higher result.      |
|   23      |   Fateful Visions        | Consume a Glitch and spend a few moments in quiet meditation. Ask the GM a question pertaining to the current situation.  You will be granted a bizarre vision that provides enlightening information. GM rolls a d4 in secret; on a 1, the vision is deceptive.       |
|   24      |   Dope Fiend        | An experienced drug user. -1 for all DR tests to resist negative effects of drugs .        |
|   25      |  First Strike         | Whether your side passes or fails the initiative roll, you may always act first if your action involves inflicting harm.         |
|   26      |  Reckless Blow          |   When wielding two-handed weapons, you may swing with DR+2. If the attack lands, you add d6 to your damage. Missing allows your opponent to strike with an attack that you can defend against at DR+2.       |
|   31      |  Harbinger of Misery         | Gain 4 maximum Glitches instead of 2. As long as you live, the GM rolls two Misery dice every day.   |
|   32      |  Home-Chemist         |  Once per day, you may scrounge to find the necessary chemical substances to to create an infection-curing elixir that also heals d4 HP.  Test Presence DR12 to attempt this treatment. Failing instead creates a toxin dealing d4 damage.      |
|   33      |  Hyper Awareness         |  You can never be the victim of a surprise attack. Additionally, your side takes the initiative on 3+.  |
|   34      |  Inspired Storyteller         | Test Presence DR9 whenever resting to weave a compelling tale. Increase the DR+1 for every additional audience member. Success allows everyone to gain a Glitch. None can exceed their maximum number of Glitches.         |
|   35      |   Likeable        | Whenever a reaction roll is made, roll 3d6 and keep the highest two dice.         |
|   36      |   Deadly Draw        |  Your first ranged attack always deals max damage, assuming it hits. If you miss, your opponent may attack you. This can be defended against at DR+2.        |
|   41      |   Negotiator        |  Test Presence, DR6 + opponents’ highest morale for a chance to de-escalate a situation or gain a bargaining advantage.|
|   42      | Outback Survivalist          |   Test Presence DR9 to create a comfortable campsite. DR+1 for every additional person it shelters. When resting at this camp, everyone recovers 2d6 HP instead of d6.       |

|   45      |   Connected       |  Gain another contact or increase an existing contact's level. Can be taken multiple times.     |
|   46      |     Cyberware adapted      | DR-2 for resisting Cy Rage.  |
|   51      |   Sniper        |   When **aiming** receive both Dr-2 to hit and +2 to damage.     |
|   52      |  Leader         |  Your hirelings receive a +2 bonus to morale checks.    |
|   53      |  Tough.         |  When **Battered**, roll twice and take the better result.      |
|   54      |  Ear to the Street.         | You can easily pick up rumors in the city.         |
|   55      |    Grit       |    Gain +4 HP (this is always added after you change your HP from regular Advancement)      |
|   56      |   Street Cred        | You are known among gutter punks. Gain a +1 on First Impressions with streetfolk and enemies from the streets receive +1 on their morale checks.         |
|   61      |    Trigger Happy     |  Your autofire can hit more than 3 targets.  If you hit 3 or more targets, you have to immediately do an Ammo roll.      |
|   62      | Stealthy As Fuck          |  All tests related to Stealth are reduced by -2DR. Stacks with other abilities.      |
|   63      |  Bland         |  You don't trigger suspicion and your features are very forgettable. First Impressions tend towards neutral.   |
|   64      | Guts          | -1 DR on any Presence tests to confront fear or intimidation attempts.         |
|   65      |  Nano resistance         |You can attempt an additional DR12 Toughness test to resist the effects of a nano power. Cannot use nano powers.|
|   66      | Gearhead          |  -2 DR on all tests to tinker with gear, electronics, or mechanics.       |




# Dying Rules

When a PC goes to zero or fewer HP, roll on the **Battered** table. Any subsequent damage triggers a Toughness test for death.
