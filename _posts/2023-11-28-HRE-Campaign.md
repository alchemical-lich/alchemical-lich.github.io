**9/26/1631**: Prior excursion to the Keudel Mausoleum

- Mad Tim, Sid, Magnus, and the hired retainer Meister Fritz explore the crypt under the Keudel family mausoleum.

- Following the explorations of Gerenscer et al., they push deep into the secret temple of Joz'Quatl.

- They make their way to the sanctum of the temple and find a strange, bottomless pit, a toad idol, an organ, and a separate room hiding the lost book Call of the Toad and a large, grey slime.

- The party is able to recover several silver toad statuettes and the book, leaving the terrifying slime behind.

- Total treasure recovered: 1280 gp in coins, 1 sold silver toad statuette (1200 gp), 1 sold homunculus (1000 gp), a spellbook (Hold Person, Detect Invisible), sheet music *The Call of Life**, one magical toad statuette that works like a small trumpet (magical, not sold).
