**9/29/1631**:

- THE DEED IS DONE!

- The party returned to Bruckstadt and re-grouped. Bromely's brother, Cromely, joined up. The next day, freshly supplied with vials of holy water, they returned to the lowest level of the old catacombs, avoiding any run-ins with the raised dead.

- Again, they had to face the ghost of the inquisitor--Magnus nearly perished from the torture.

- Using sanctified weapons and the deadwood sword, they dispersed the shadowy apparition and ventured North.

- Besting a giant spider and a group of eyeless women, the party pushed closer and closer to the Crypt of St. James.

- A wild giant nearly cut down one of them, when Mad Tim used an arcane weaving to charm the man. 

- They faced off with a tortured axe murderer before discovering the Crypt of St. James. There, a crazed Father Brin, now serving the ghost of St. James, stood in their way. The Father, with one mighty blow, cracked Magnus' skull, putting him at death's door. The joint efforts of the others were enough to overcome the priest and replace the burial shroud, keeping the ghost of St. James bound to the catacombs for another ten years.

- They returned to the surface to claim the deed to Castle Aarhorst! 

- What adventure awaits the mercenary company next?
