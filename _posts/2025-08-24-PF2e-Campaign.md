**11 Gozren 4721**: The Laboratory

The party prepares for their return to the Laboratory. Equipped with new items and a strategy, they quickly kill the Irnakurse. As the creature falls, double doors open behind the party and a group of Jafaki's henchmen descends upon them.

A tense battle unfolds in which Corbin is knocked unconscious, but the party prevails. Skrall's wise use of *Blur* protected the party several times.
