Here are some thoughts on how to use CY_BORG to play Shadowrun.

# Setting Adjustments:

- The megacity CY arose out of the ruins of Northern Europe. It stretches across what used to be Hamburg in the Southwest, Rostock in the Southeast, to Copenhagen and Malmö in the North, and the rest of former Denmark. Northern Germany, Poland, and the rest of Scandinavia are associated territories, full of industrial parks, ag and server farms, smaller commuter cities, and toxic wasteland ruled by Nomad clans. 

- The rest of the Shadowrun universe can be used as is.

- At some point after 2020, nanotech became all the rage. By now, most biological matter has active and defunct nanobots in their system. 

- Instead of the standard Awakening from the SR universe, asteroids fell on earth and caused widespread calamities. The asteroids carried different strains of alien bacteria that interacted with the nanobot technology and spread across many biological life forms. The first generation of bacterial strains caused Metatype mutations, other, more recent variants, manifested as magical powers.


# Character Creation

## Metatypes

| **Metatype** | **Ability Roll Adjustment**| **Extra Effect** |
|----------|-----------|----|
| Human  |  as rolled by class |  +1 Glitches   |
| Elf | +1 to Presence or Agility, -1 to Toughness |  Graceful: -1 DR on tests to charm/lie|
|Dwarf | +1 to Toughness, -1 Agility | Hardy: +1 to Toughness tests against pathogen and toxin resistance|
| Ork | +1 to Toughness or Strength, -1 to Presence | Predator: low-light vision|
|Troll | +2 to Toughness or Strength or +1 each, -1 to Agility, -1 to Presence, | Natural Armor (+1 to any armor roll), Large: -1 DR STR test in melee, +2 DR defense, things cost 2x |

## HP
PVNKS start with maximum HP and there are modified dying rules (see below).

## Skills
CY_BORG has no skill system, but skills play an integral role in Shadowrun. 

### Failed Careers 
PVNKS start with a failed career that defines some of their pre-existing skills and knowledge. Make one up, roll on the table below, or look at the NPC Role table on p.116.


| **D20** | Career|
|---------|-------|
| 1 | Backalley Doctor |
| 2 | Disgraced Corporate Drone | 
| 3 | Street Hustler | 
| 4 | Failed Entertainer, Social media influencer|
| 5 | Ganger/low-level criminal|
| 6 | Laid-off programmer | 
| 7 | Failed scientist | 
| 8 | Fraudulent accountant, white collar criminal | 
| 9 | Factory worker |
| 10 | Drug dealer|
| 11 | EMT | 
| 12 | Low-rent bounty hunter   |
| 13 | Mercenary |
| 14 | Drugged out pilot|
| 15 | Semi-professional gambler | 
| 16 | Recently released convict |
| 17 | Clickbait journalist/writer|
| 18 | Hazard zone survivalist |
| 19 | Cybertech maintenance tech | 
| 20 | Political activist | 

## Detailed Skills
Characters have a list of **skills** with varying **ratings**, ranging from **untrained** (**+0**), to **trained** (**+2**), **expert** (**+3**), to  **master** (**+4**).

Skill tests use the associated attribute modifier + the skill rating vs. DR. Some skill checks are only possible for trained skills.

At **character creation**, PVNKS get to pick **two skills** in which they have achieved the **trained** rank, based on their **failed career**. They also get **one additional trained skill** that can be chosen freely, representing personal interests. 


They also get one Knowledge or Language Skill at the **trained** rating. For every positive ability modifier in their Knowledge Attribute, they get an additional Knowledge or Language Skill at **trained** proficiency.

In RAW CY_BORG, attribute modifiers range from -3 to +3 (with an average modifier of +0) vs. a standard DR12 (DR ranges from 6 to 18). This implies an average success probability of 45%, a max success probability of 90% (+3 vs DR6) and a minimum success probability of 0% (-3 vs. DR18).

Adding skill ratings increases the range of modifiers from -3 to +7. This makes PVNKS slightly more competent, which is probably OK because Shadowrunners are professional operators. A trained PC has now a 55% chance of success against a normal task, while a world-class expert (**Master**) has a 80% chance. If you prefer to keep the game gritty, scale up the DR list on p.41 by 1 or 2 points (e.g., standard DR become 13 or 14).


| **Skill** | **Associated Attributes** |
|---------------------------|------|
| Stealth  | Agility|
| Piloting  | Agility|
| Repair  | Knowledge|
| Program |Knowledge|
| Demolitions  |Knowledge|
| Talk  |Presence|
| Trade  |Presence|
| Perception  |Presence|
| Etiquette  |Presence|
| Intimidation |Presence, Strength, Toughness|
| Leadership |Presence|
| Perform | Presence|
| Athletics | Strength, Agility |
| Unarmed Combat  | Strength|
| Outdoors  | Toughness| 
| Melee        | Strength   |
| Ranged Weapons | Agility|
| Nanopowers | Presence |
| *Knowledge and Language Skills* |Knowledge|



## Contacts
Each PVNK starts the game with two level 1 **Contacts** or one level 2 **Contact**. Roll on the NPC table on p.116.

**Level 1 Contacts**- Standard contact. Merely an acquaintance. Level 1 contacts will charge for meaningful information and help.

**Level 2 Contacts**- A friend. You have done each other some favors and there is a certain level of trust. DR-2 on any Presence check when attempting to get a Level 2 contact to do something for you. Level 2 contact will not charge for simple things.

**Level 3 Contacts**- A true friend. A rare thing in CY. If a test is needed to convince the contact to help you in some way, you receive Advantage on the Presence roll. Level 3 contacts are predisposed to doing favors for free.


# Cyberware

Use rules as written with the following adjustments:

- Every piece of Cyberware increases the DR for nanopower/magic tests by +1.

- Every piece of Cyberware increases the DR for social test by +1.

# Magic/Nanopowers
New Nano-powers/magic can be acquired in-game. Procedures vary. It always takes Karma Points to successfully acquire a new Nano-power and sometimes also costs credits.

The Nano-Power Skill increases the chances of successfully activating a Nano-power, giving you a bonus on your activation test. Your nanopower skill also makes it more difficult for targets of your power to resist. If the power call for a resistance test, adjust the DR by your skill rating.

## Controlling and Unleashing Nano-powers
A key feature of Shadowrun magic is the ability to decide the amount of risk and reward involved in casting a spell. RAW CY_Borg has a risk attached to activating nano-powers, but gives no opportunity for characters to affect that risk. By RAW, activating a nano-power is also fairly difficult, which makes it very risky. 


I think two changes are in order: 1) Introducing the **Nanopower skill** increases the baseline success chance, which addresses basic competence; 2) The **Controlled/Unleashing** rules below allow a minimum of tactical choice in the activation of nano-powers.

Nano-powers can be activated with more **control** or **unleashed** at great risk. This allows the PC to pick a risk-reward level that they are comfortable with. A **controlled** approach increases the chances of success dramatically at the guaranteed cost of damage. **Unleashing** nanopowers brings the higher risk of failure and more damage, but promises greatly amplified effects on a success.

| Activation | DR     | Success | Failure | Fumble|
|------------|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| Controlled | DR8    | Standard Effect + 1d2 damage| 1d2 damage| 1|
| Regular    | DR12   | Standard Effect | 1d2 damage | 1 |
| Unleashed  | DR16   | Pick one: double duration, double range, double damage, target another creature, DR to resist +4, alter effect substantially| 1d6 damage| 1--4|




## Astral Perception and Astral Projection
Everyone that has acquired a nanopower also acquires the ability to perceive magical energy created by nanobacteria. It takes a Presence DR12 check to activate this sight ability. 

Astral Projection is not directly available in CY_BORG, but the **Swarm trip** nanopower offers a similar functionality.



## Magical wards
tbd

## Summoning
Summoning can be done via the acquisition of new nanopowers (see below)

## New Nanopowers

Here are some additional powers:

| **Power** | **Effect**|
|-----------|------------|
| **Read Thoughts**| Target tests Presence 14 to resist. Reveals 1-2 important pieces of information. |
| **Suggest**  | Target has to test Presence 16 or be swayed by the suggestion.     |
| **Dominate** | Target has to test Presence DR10 or fall under the command of the user for 1d6 minutes. Commands that but the target into serious danger cause, trigger another Presence test.     |
| **Stun** | Target has to test Presence DR12 or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. Target can test again on subsequent turns to end the condition.   |
| **Silence**| Enforce silence on a circular area with a 10 m radius.    |
| **Change Face**| Change your face for 1d6 hours.  |
| **Cloak**| Become invisible and cloaked from visual sensors for 1d6 minutes. +/- 2 on all attack and defense tests.   |
| **Fly**| Gain the ability to fly at your regular speed for 1d6 X 10 minutes.   |
| **Summon Aberration**| Summon a mutated beast with the stats of a **Warg** (p.100) for 1d6 hours. The creature will obey your commands. If you die or become unconscious, the create will 1--3 vanish or 4--6 attack the nearest target.  |


## Magical Weapons and Foci
Some items and weapons can be infused with nano/magical powers. For foci, they can give a bonus or special effect on activation checks for nano-powers or give access to wholly new powers. Magical weapons might offer extra damage or the ability to hurt magical creatures.



## Ki-Adepts
There is no good equivalent to Ki-Adepts in the CY_BORG rules. It might require a new class and a new set of nano-powers to really get at the feeling of a Ki-Adept. 

**Nano-Adept Class**

Nano-Adepts incorporate infected nanobots into their body to permanently alter themselves. 


**HP**: Toughness +D6

Roll 3d6+2 for **Toughness**, 3d6-1 for **Presence** and **Knowledge**

D2 Glitches

You start with one permanent **nano-sculpt power**.

**Nano-Sculpt Powers** are ongoing effects that do not need to be activated. A Nano-Adept can sustain a number of nano-sculpt powers equal to their Toughness +1 for the day. Each piece of cyberware reduces this number by one. You can decide which of your nano-powers to sustain for the day after a full night of sleep (e.g., you might have access to four nano-sculpt powers but can only sustain three at any given time).

Each **nano-sculpt power** is linked to an **infestation**. Anytime you fumble on an attack or defense test, you have to test Presence DR12 to avoid triggering one of your infestations (determine randomly).
 

| **1D12**  | **Nano-Sculpt** | **Effect** |
|-------------|--------|-----------|
|1 |**Killing Hands** | Turn your hands into deadly weapons. D6 damage and ignore light armor. |
|2 |**Armor** | Infuse your skin with protective nanobots. +1 on armor rolls.  |
| 3|**Reflexes** | +2 for initiative rolls. |
|4| **Cat's Eyes**| Night vision.  |
|5| **Dog's Nose** | Enhanced smell.  |
|6| **Pheromones**| -2DR on social Presence tests. | 
|7| **Combat Sense**| -2 DR on Defense tests.|
|8| **Frog Jump** | Double jumping distances and heights.|
|9| **Third Arm**| You have grown a third arm. You can hold an extra item and gain a -2 DR on grappling attempts.|
|10| **Regeneration** | Recover 1 HP per combat round at the end of your turn.|
|11| **Meld into Shadows** | -4DR on Agility tests to evade detection. Also affects cameras and other sensors.|
|12| **Spiderclimb** | You can scale vertical surfaces with ease.|

1. Increase HP.

2. Increase Attribute modifiers.

3. Increase Skill Ratings

4. Acquire/adopt new Nano-infestations.

5. Training for **Talents**.

PVNKS can also use credits to acquire better gear, apps, and cyberware.

| Incorporate a new Nano-Sculpt | 8 KP| 10k |

## Talents

Adapted from Unheroic Feats in MB Heretic. 

**Talents** can be acquired by PVNKs when improving between missions (see p.89). PVNKS can gain up to three **Talents**. The first costs 10k, the second 25k, the third 50k. 

| **D66**   |**Talent** | **Effect**|
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
|   11      |    Assassin       |    Test Strength DR12 to grapple an unaware foe and automatically crit with a one-handed bladed weapon or a garotte.      |
|   12      |     Spiritualist      |  Sacrifice 1k to regain a lost Glitch (once per day)        |
|   13      |  Bare-Knuckle Brawler        |  Your unarmed attacks deal d6 damage and ignore light armor. You may take this Feat a second time, increasing to d8 damage, and a third time to d10 damage. If you crit on an attack, you also stun your enemy.  Fumbling an unarmed attack means you break a hand, dealing the damage to yourself. You must seek out a specialist to help you set your bones. |
|   14      |   Spree-Killer        |  When landing an attack that kills a target, you must attack another (this may include allies), adding d6 damage for every creature slain. Your onslaught stops when you fail to kill and you fall to the ground exhausted, losing your next turn.|
|   15      |   Field Medic        |  Test Agility DR12 to return a **Battered** PC to 1 HP.       |
|   16      |  Precision Striker         |  Once per turn, when making a ranged or melee attack, roll damage with advantage. |
|   21      | Expert        |   Pick a technical or academic field of expertise. Checks for your area of expertise have advantage. Can be picked multiple times.       |
|   22      |   Dual Wielder    |  You have trained to fight with two weapons. Roll both damage dice and keep the higher result.      |
|   23      |   Fateful Visions        | Consume a Glitch and spend a few moments in quiet meditation. Ask the GM a question pertaining to the current situation.  You will be granted a bizarre vision that provides enlightening information. GM rolls a d4 in secret; on a 1, the vision is deceptive.       |
|   24      |   Dope Fiend        | An experienced drug user. -1 for all DR tests to resist negative effects of drugs .        |
|   25      |  First Strike         |  You gain a +1 to initiative rolls and your first attack in combat gains **Advantage**.         |
|   26      |  Reckless Blow          |   When wielding two-handed weapons, you may swing with DR+2. If the attack lands, you add d6 to your damage. Missing allows your opponent to strike with an attack that you can defend against at DR+2.       |
|   31      |  Harbinger of Misery         | Gain 4 maximum Glitches instead of 2. As long as you live, the GM rolls two Misery dice every day.   |
|   32      |  Home-Chemist         |  Once per day, you may scrounge to find the necessary chemical substances to to create an infection-curing elixir that also heals d4 HP.  Test Presence DR12 to attempt this treatment. Failing instead creates a toxin dealing d4 damage.      |
|   33      |  Hyper Awareness         |  You can never be the victim of a surprise attack. Additionally, your side takes the initiative on 3+.  |
|   34      |  Tough as Nails         | You ignore all DR modifiers from **Wounds**.         |
|   35      |   Likeable        | Whenever a reaction roll is made, roll 3d6 and keep the highest two dice.         |
|   36      |   Deadly Draw        |  Your first ranged attack always deals max damage, assuming it hits. If you miss, your opponent may attack you. This can be defended against at DR+2.        |
|   41      |   Negotiator        |  Test Presence, DR6 + opponents’ highest morale for a chance to de-escalate a situation or gain a bargaining advantage.|
|   42      | Outback Survivalist          |   Test Presence DR9 to create a comfortable campsite. DR+1 for every additional person it shelters. When resting at this camp, everyone recovers 2d6 HP instead of d6.       |
|   43      |   Catering Chef        | Test Presence DR9 to cook a meal when resting. On success, each PC may roll the D6 HP recovery with Advantage.   |
|   44      |  Ammo hoarder         |   Only loose ammo on 1-2.       |
|   45      |   Connected       |  Gain another contact or increase an existing contact's level. Can be taken multiple times.     |
|   46      |     Cyberware adapted      | DR-2 for resisting Cy Rage.  |
|   51      |   Sniper        |   When **aiming** receive both Dr-2 to hit and +2 to damage.     |

|   53      |  Tough.         |  When **Battered**, roll twice and take the better result.      |
|   54      |  Ear to the Street.         | You can easily pick up rumors in the city.         |
|   55      |    Grit       |    Gain +4 HP (this is always added after you change your HP from regular Advancement)      |
|   56      |   Street Cred        | You are known among gutter punks. Gain a +1 on First Impressions with streetfolk and enemies from the streets receive +1 on their morale checks.         |
|   61      |    Trigger Happy     |  Your autofire can hit more than 3 targets.  If you hit 3 or more targets, you have to immediately do an Ammo roll.      |
|   62      | Stealthy As Fuck          |  All tests related to Stealth are reduced by -2DR. Stacks with other abilities.      |
|   63      |  Bland         |  You don't trigger suspicion and your features are very forgettable. First Impressions tend towards neutral.   |
|   64      | Guts          | -1 DR on any Presence tests to confront fear or intimidation attempts.         |
|   65      |  Nano resistance         |You can attempt an additional DR12 Toughness test to resist the effects of a nano power. Cannot use nano powers.|
|   66      | Gearhead          |  -2 DR on all tests to tinker with gear, electronics, or mechanics.       |





# Dying Rules
HP represent stamina, grit, and luck, not health. They represent how long you can avoid actual damage. 

When a PC hits 0 HP or less, they have to test Toughness test with DR 12:

  - On a success, the PC stays conscious but takes one **Wound**. For every **Wound**, all future DR tests (except for damage resistance) are increased by 1 point. If a PC accumulates wounds equal to their Toughness modifier +1 (minimum of 2), they automatically die.
  
  - On a failure, they roll on the **Battered** table.

Recovering from a single **Wound** takes a varying amount of time.

| **Quality of Medical Care**| **Costs** | **Effect** |
|------------------------------|----------|------------|
| Shady Doc | 500 credits | Test Toughness DR12 after 3 days of rest to recover from 1 wound.|
| Regular Doc | 1000 credits | Test Toughness DR6 after 3 days of rest to recover from 1 wound.|
| Premium Doc | 4000 credits| Automatic recovery from one wound after 3 days.|
| High-end Care | 10,000 credits| Automatic recovery from one wound after 1 day.|



# NPCs

## NPC Skills
Some NPCs have specialty skills and professional training. Generally, it is probably easiest to just give an NPC a **threat rating** (0 untrained; 1 trained; 2 professional; 4 veteran; 5 world-class) that can be applied generally. 

In contested tests, adjust the DR for the PC by the skill rating of the NPC. This applies to combat tests as well. Examples: A PC is trying to defend against an attack by an NPC with a particular skill in melee. Instead of using the normal DR12, adjust the DR up by the skill rating of the NPC.

## NPC Health
Enemies die on zero HP and cannot incur wounds.
