**Session 3 Music of the Spheres is Chaos**

The heroes enter the Alembic and begin to explore. They take a quick look at the Earth door but retreat. As they moved into the center of the Alembic, a wave of Chaos erupts and washes over them. They avoid death by the skin of their teeth. The sludge forms into three Chaos Spawn, which the party handles quickly.

The move West and enter the Fire chamber. They explore the strange rooms, kill another Chaos spawn, and eventually find two devils, trapped in summoning circles. They ignore their pleading and leave the room, but not before Luka mercy kills a remaining Theophage that had been flayed on a torturer's table. 

They find another room with a large pentagram on the ground and a black sphere floating in the middle. They approach and silver flames erupt, trapping most of them in the middle. The sphere moves toward Margerite. As they try to figure out how to escape the trap, they hear a cackling voice from the other room, commanding them to submit. Totino casts Spiderclimb and sneaks toward the voice--another devil seems to be commanding the trap and sphere with a silver skull. As Totino climbs toward the devil, Margerite uses Force Manipulation to create small opening for Obi-Wan and Luka to get past the flames toward the devil.

Totino jumps down and attempts to paralyze the devil, but fails. The devil shoots an eldritch magic missile at Totino, who collapses to the ground. The devil takes Obi-Wan hostage and commands them to pledge their souls to a quest on his behalf: to reclaim his true name from the Water dungeon. Obi-Wan heals Totino and, as they negotiate, Luka uses his ring to make himself invisible. He sneaks up from behind and backstabs the devil. A fight ensues in which the devil cuts Luka down with his sword, but not before being blinded. Totino uses the opening to paralyze the devil and the heroes prevail. 

Beyond the devil, they find a small throne room, occupied by the Prince of Flame and his consort. He seems bored but reveals to the party that the Theophages treated with him to open the Elemental Gate of Fire. He is open to closing it again, but requests a pile of valuable gems and Luka's sword Sparklefang. Miserly Colin refuses. The Prince becomes annoyed with the party and challenges them to a feat of strength. Colin agrees. Totino attempts to give Colin a pep talk, but his Crab mouth only causes unease in Colin. Luckily, Totino also casts Strength on Colin and imbues him with super human might.

Colin and the Prince enter a tense wrestling match. They go back and forth. Colin holds his own, but the flaming aura of the Prince starts to wear him down. At the last second, with a lucky gamble, Colin is able to pin the Prince and win the contest. The Prince is impressed and congratulates Colin. He agrees to close the Elemental Gate and gifts the party his mighty scimitar *The Prince's Claw*.
