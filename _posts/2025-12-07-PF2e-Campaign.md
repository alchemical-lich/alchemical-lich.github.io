**14-15 Gozren 4721**: The Prison

Back in Otari, the heroes try to help Dorianna Menhemes. They craft a protective charm and observe her during the night. Past midnight, she leaves her room and walks to the town center, attempting to kill the blacksmith Carman Rajani. They heroes stop this from happening and are also able to exploit the link between Dorianna and the Motley Man, spying his lair.

The next day, they return to the Prison Level. Through a secret door, they find a passage that leads to the lair of the Motley Man. They confront the strange creature, but he casts a Suggestion spell on the kobold, forcing the party to retreat and regroup.
