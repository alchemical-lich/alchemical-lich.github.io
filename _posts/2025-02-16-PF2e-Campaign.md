**6 Gozren 4721**: Lionlodge

The dinner escalates as Skrall tries to step outside and realizes the door has been locked. While Arryn is temporarily addled by some poison, the three dwarves move in to capture the party/ The heroes resist and quickly slay the enemies--realizing they were made from snow!

They explore the lodge and find evidence Auldegrund is a worshipper of Alocer, a Duke of Hell, favored by hunters. As they rifle through his secret workshop (after killing a Barbazu devil), they barely avoid being surprised by the returning Auldegrund and three cultists. 

A quick battle ends with the cultists dead on the ground and the party victorious. They secure paperwork that shows Auldegrund was behind the sabotage of the flume and has been funneling money to Carman Rajani. Auldegrund seems to have been hired by a lawyer from Absalom: Melandrach Moon-Tear.
