**12/24/1631 -- 12/30/1631**:

- The Wolfguard Scouts hear the news of Archbishop Hatzfeld's return to WÃ¼rzburg. The people are calling it a Christmas Miracle. The Archbishop blames identifies the Wolfguard as the culprit for his abduction, with the secret support of the city of Bruckstadt, and Protestant sycophants in the region. He is calling on all true Catholics to rally to his banner to exact retribution. Uh-oh.

- The Scouts return to Castle Xyntillan and begin to explore the second level. They discover a library and other well-appointed rooms.

- They recover a copy of the Symphonies of Ludwig van Schreck, a spellbook, and a magical shield of a famous Crusader.

- In the end, they are ambushed by a group of Shadows. A difficult battle leaves Bupki turned into a Shadow. The Wolfguard emerges victorious in the end, but at great cost.

- Recovered treasure: Symphonies of Ludwig von Schreck (3,000 gp), Spellbook, A jar with eyeballs, +2 Crusader Shield, Mirror (1,200 gp).
