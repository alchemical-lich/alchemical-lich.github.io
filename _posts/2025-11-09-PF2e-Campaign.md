**13-14 Gozren 4721**: The Laboratory

The party delves into the prison level of the Abomination Vaults. They destroy a devil training of group of Grothluts. They then encounter a fly devil and several fleshwarped Morlocks, killing them quickly. On the fly devil, they find a piece of a pentragram amulet.

They find two areas blocked by infernal barriers. To the North, they confront a devil smith who is forging an arsenal of weapons. On him, they find another piece of the pentagram amulet. To the South, they encounter more fleshwarped beasts.
