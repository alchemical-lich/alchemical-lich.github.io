**10/03/2016**:

- Operation MALTA commences. The team is ordered to Seattle, Washington under the guise of an ad-hoc FBI task force.

- Tibaut Gieves and his girlfriend Amanda Griffin were found dead at their house. The local police discovered a secret bio-lab in their garage. The CDC collected samples but the plane transporting them to Atlanta crashed in Idaho.

- The team arrives at 8 am in Seattle. They begin with background research on Tibaut Grieves and a walkthrough of the crime scene. They discover that Grieves was a wealthy geneticist that worked at DARPA in the past. He uses a shell company to secretly build his lab, financed by Potentia Holdings, LLC, which is also tied to the lawyer Aaron Silverman and a man named Robert Justin Ortega. Apparently, Tibaut's house was also under surveillance by a private detective named Eveyln Wells.

- Wells' office was firebombed the morning of the 3rd and an attempt on her life was executed on the morning of the 4th. The team learns that she was hired by Potentia Holdings to make deliveries to Grieves. 

- The team goes to the Medical Examiners office to convince the Chief Medical Examiner to take a look at the remains of Grieves and Griffin. They find a strange blue discoloration on the esophagus of Griffin. Dr. Stubbs pushes deeper and suddenly a blue organic mass erupts from the body, going for the doctors face. A scuffle ensues and Karl is attacked by the substance. He feels an icy cold entering his veins...
