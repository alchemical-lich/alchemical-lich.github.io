**14-15 Gozren 4721**: The Prison

They regroup after fleeing from Ysondkhelir. Casting additional protective spells, they return to his lair to find him having fled to an adjacent room.

They enter the vast chamber and find the hall filled with many unstable stasis pods, filled with monstrous beings. 
As they approach, unstable energies discharge from the pods, hurting the heroes and releasing several monsters. Skrall lobs a fireball at Ysondkhelir, hurting him, but alos destroying another stasis pod.

Realizing the situation is quickly getting out of hand, the heroes make another strategic retreat, firing Force Barrages at the Denizen of Leng, while he is being mauled by a Ghontine.

This proofs to be a winning strategy. The heroes manage to slay Ysondkhelir and let the remaining monster weaken each other. The villain is slain and Doriana Menhemes is finally safe/

From Ysonkhelir they retrieve another piece of the pentagram amulet.
