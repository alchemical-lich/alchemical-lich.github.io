**5--6 Gozren 4721**: Otari

The heroes meet with Oseph Menhemes to get his support in their further exploration of the Gauntlight and their investigation of the dwarf saboteurs. He willingly gifts them his ancestor's brooch and wants to be kept abreast of their investigation of the dwarves. He also asked them for another favor: to tutor his daughter.

With two of the four relics in hand, the party goes to the Dawnflower Library to learn that the blade of Vol Rajani has been stolen! They investigate the crime scene and quickly identify Carman Rajani as a suspect. They track him to Smuggler's Refuge, small cave in the vicinity of the Gauntlight. They confront Carman who surrenders after a quick scuffle. The heroes promise to keep him out of jail and he surrenders his family's blade. 

Back in Otari, they find the last missing artifact with Morlibint. The old wizard reluctantly entrusts Zarmavdian's spellbook to Corbin.

In the afternoon of Gozren 7, they make their way to the Lionlodge for the mysterious dinner. They are greeted by Auldegrund Grimcarver and two dwarf servants. He serves dinner and makes a proposal: work for him and his employer to explore the Gauntlight and increase their influence in Otari. 

As the party considers the offer, Skrall attempts to make a distraction, while Arryn seems to be affected by some poison.
