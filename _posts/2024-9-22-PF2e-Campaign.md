**26 Pharast 4721**: The Flume

- The party rests a few days in Otari. Arryn has a strange dream about Belcorra Haruvex, taking the perspective of Volluk Azrinae.

- They decide to take up Klorte Hengus' request to investigate the sabotage of the flume. They walk the flume and inspect the remains of the fires. Both attacks targeted weak spots of the flume. The burn marks are consistent with a focused magical or alchemical fire. They find no useful tracks in the wider area.

- The return to town and ask around about outsiders purchasing ingredients for alchemical fire bombs. Rizzard and Corbin play cards at the Crook's Nook and learn that dwarf visited Otari and purchased some poison. They ask around a bit more and learn the dwarf bought a large amount of provisions and ale as well. The name Morgrym Leadbuster comes up.

- They also check on Carman Rajani, who they find sleeping of a bender. Witnesses confirm he was seen in town the last few days.

- During the night, they post up at one of the two remaining weak points on the Flume. They get lucky and spring an ambush on a Popanz and two hellhounds. They overwhelm the enemies, but not without receiving some painful burns. The Popanz, clearly not the brightest, quickly spills the beans. He was hired by a group of dwarven brothers--the Leadbuster Clan. There are 4 or 5 of them and they have a temporary lair at Maunder Bridge. They gave him gold and the two hellhounds to sabotage the flume. Given the gold coins they use, it seems the Leadbusters come from Cheliax...
