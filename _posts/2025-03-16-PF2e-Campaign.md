**7 Gozren 4721**: The Arena

Further exploring the Arena level, the heroes discover several empty cells. One is filled with a strange black, oily substance. Suddenly, a pseudopod forms and attempts to grab Zazgazan. After a tactical retreat to the Mead Hall, they dispatch the dangerous ooze.

Further North, they free Chafkem, a mummy from Osirian and former administrator of the Arena. He tells them he was locked in by a worm named Chafkem. The imperious mummy demands to be released but the heroes stand their ground. A fight erupts and the mummy vanishes with the help of an invisibility spell.
