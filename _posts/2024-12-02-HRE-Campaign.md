**12/24/1631 -- 12/30/1631**:

- The Wolfguard expands their domain and hires additional troops. In their exploration of the surrounding lands, they discover a lair of Frogmen. Instead of meeting them with violence, they make a deal with their chieftain--Globgar. For a mere 30 gold per month, the Frogmen will protect their flank.

- Apart from troops, the Wolfguard also hires a spy to move South. The spy is to gather information about the Archbishop's efforts of raising an army.
