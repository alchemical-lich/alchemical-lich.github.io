**Day 5--8 on the Tolomak Isles -- Continued**
The giant sea turtle bobs in the ocean water and the crew devises a plan. Using the rowboats, they paddle over and climb up the ladder affixed to the turtle's shell. On the top, they find a strange metal grate and cranking mechanism. They open the grate and find a 10ft access shaft. Luka descends first, followed by the rest. Tottino keeps his distance, emanating an Aura of Death. Down in the turtle's shell, they find a room with two exits. Silt, and seaweed on the ground, fishes flopping and gasping. They follow the tunnel that descends deeper down. It leads them to a room covered in barnacles, shells, and coral. On the far side, a large double door with writing on door frame. Luka and Colin approach. As they inspect the door, three humanoids attempt to surprise them. An undead warrior goes for Colin, but Colin hits first--and hard. A massive blow with Colin's shield smashes the warrior against the wall. The warrior swings his rusty falchion at Colin but misses. As the creature comes close to Colin, an eel bursts from its chest and snaps at the dwarf. At the same time, Luka is cornered by a dagger-wielding undead and a swarm of crabs. On the other side of the room, Margerite is attacked by an undead elf with a coral face and fists. The coral is poisoned and Margerite slumps to the ground unconscious after a jab to her chin. 

The group fights hard and eventually destroys all three undead, saving Margerite with a healing potion. They are able to recover two golden lobster claws from the door but fail to decipher the writing. As they open the door, a curse washes over them! Colin Robinson and Obi Wan Cannoli change bodies, while Tottino is turned into a 4ft fiddler crab. What a terrible trap the wizard has lain!

Behind the doors, they find treasure and a metal key, which likey unlocks the Earth Prison. They explore the rest of the vault and find more treasure...and a deadly Sea Anemone that peppers Margerite with three poisonous spikes. They leave the sea turtle vault, laden with treasure. After resting for a night, they paddle towards the big caldera North of islands. In the middle of the caldera, they spy a small island, surrounded by tarry water. As they come closer, they can see a colony of Arachno-Men in the caldera walls. They dispatch two boats to pursue opur heroes. The party decides to be prudent and to retreat for now.

They rest for two days on the beach, giving time to recover and formulate a plan. Crab-Tino formulates a parallel infiltration from air and sea. Using two jellyfish suits, Carb-Tino, Luka, and Colin Cannoli swim under water towards the Earth Prison, while Margerite conjures a floating disk of energy to transport herself and Obi-Wan Robinson through the air. They approach the Earth Prison unseen and discover the entrance to is ajar. The whole prison building is showing several cracks. Inside, the floor is covered with tarry water. They begin to epxlore and find occult symbols that speak of a string warding spell, keeping something inside, although the cracks in the stone have weakened the magic. Through a tunnel, they encounter a nearly collapsed room. Luke wakes an elemental lizard. Fearing the beast's attacks, the groupd retreats while the cavern collapses. Whatever or whoever is really imprisoned here?
