**3--4 Gozren 4721**: Belcorra's Retreat

- They keep exploring Belcorra's Retreat and discover a long hallway with sarcophagi, containing the dead bodies of Belcorra's enemies. To the South a ghostly barrier blocks the way to a descending staircase. To the North, an octagonal room holds a shrine of Nimbaloth.

- As the party approaches the shrine, two Cairn Wrights emerge and attack but are handled quickly. In the temple, Skrall shoots lightning at two severed hands, which causes them to animate and attack. The hands are joined by four Flickerwisps, which confuse Zazgazan and Corbin. In the end, the party is able to overcome the strange creatures. A strange sense of despair permeates the temple.

- A door to the West leads to a torture chamber. A devilish Velstrac greets the party, annoyed by their disruption. A quick-witted ruse by Corbin, pretending to deliver Zazgazan and Skrall for torture, lets the party approach. Arryn attempts to move the Velstrac, who identified herself as Vaulgrist, into one of the cages with the Boneshaker spell but fails. The Velstrac lashes out with her chains. A tense battle ensues that sees Corbin nearly bleed out, but two massive blows with his magical war hammer crush the devil's skull and end the threat. They recover a blood-red magical whip with a *Ghosttouch* rune.

- The party returns to Otari and find a letter has been delivered for them: Auldegrund Grimcarver has invited them for a dinner at Lionhead Lodge to discuss a business opportunity...
