- **Jala** invites the party to stay in the **Otari Guildhouse**.

- The party arrives in **Otari**, rests, shops for supplies, and does some basic research on the **Gauntlight**. They learn it was built by one **Belcorra Haruvex**.

- The town is dominated by the fishing and lumber industries. The families **Menhemes**, **Inkleholtz**, and **Chertel** are the wealthiest lumber merchants in town.
