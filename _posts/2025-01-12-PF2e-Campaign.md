**4--5 Gozren 4721**: Belcorra's Retreat

After a night's rest, the heroes return to the Gauntlight. They explore to the East of the Temple of Nimbaloth and discover an illusory wall, behind which Belcorra's private quarters are hidden. They push inside and are confronted by a Voidglutton, a strange creature that causes despair. The group rallies and their combined might destroys it. The find a strange trophy room where Belcorra displayed some of her old enemies. At least they recover several magic items.

To the South, the encounter Jaul Mezmin, a druid werewolf, wanted for murder. As the heroes approach, Jaul unleashes a lightning bolt on the whole party. In the ensuing melee, Corbin gets hurt badly--Jaul tears our his throat and only Arryn's healing saves him. The group overwhelms Jaul in the end and begs for mercy. They question him for information but he does not trust them. As Corbin threatens his wolf, Jaul breaks his restraints and attacks again. The heroes are forced to kill him. Arryn suspects Corbin might have contracted the Curse of the Werewolf.

Further South, they find the ghost of Otari Ilvashti, a member of the Roseguard. His spirit is bound to the Gauntlight, until Belcorra has fully destroyed. He reveals that Belcorra's ghost is stirring. She is attempting to reactivate the Gauntlight to attack Absalom. The party will need the four icons of the Roseguard to get through the magical barrier blocking access to the level below. Otari warns them that something evil is drawing ghosts to the area and it is not the Gauntlight.
