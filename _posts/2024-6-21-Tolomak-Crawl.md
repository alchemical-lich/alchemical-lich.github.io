**Day 8 on the Tolomak Isles -- Continued**

The heroes decide to explore the other direction. Crab-Tino leads the vanguard and discovers a large, rectangular room, filled with the tarry water. Eight pedestals jut out of the water and a large, 20-ft statue stands in the center of the room. As Crab-Tino enters to take a closer look at the pedestals, a tar monster forms and attacks. The others rush in to help and after a short battle, the tar ooze is felled by a deep cut of Margerita's Mithril sword, empowered by *Chill Touch*.

Beyond the room, they find a wall carving, depicting a wizard casting a spell on three women and a shark-octopus monster. Pushing further, they find a room that connects to the collapsed hall on the other side. The room is bare, except for eight large pillars and a titanic door, covered in elemental binding symbols, and a large key hole that is aflame. The group devises a plan how to use the wizard's key without getting burned. Margerita uses her Force Manipulation to manipulate the key from afar and the massive double doors open.

They step inside and see three sleeping women, suspended in a large sphere of water, floating in the middle of the room. As they approach, the sphere slowly descends. Margerita pops the water bubble with her sword and the three women awaken. The Queen opens her eyes and seems confused, asking for her sisters. The two women next to her whisper in her ear, which makes the Queen's eyes turn black and she begins to rant about her love for the wizard Shadankin. He must have cast a spell on her! The Queen's features turn shark-like and she attacks!

A wild battle ensues. In the swirling melee, Margerita is knocked unconscious, as is Crab-Tino. Even mighty Colin Cannoli goes down after being hit by 6 (!) magic missiles from the Queen. The tide of the battle turns, when Margerita calls in the power of her patron--sacrificing her own blood, she begs the Strangled Bride Dzzali to help her. So she does. Dzzali intervenes and confuses the Queen, making her unable to pick friend from foe. The moment of respite is enough for the others to slay the Queen's handmaiden and Obi-Wan Robinson to issue a prayer while speaking the Queen's true name: Qeel-Ilsh-aaha! The spell is broken and the Queen is freed.

The heroes help the Queen out of the prison and tell her about her sister's on the islands. The Sea Queen's return will likely re-establish a semblance of peace between the rivaling sisters. Now, the party sets their eyes on a new prize: getting rid of Master Zagarius and his evil merchant scheme.
