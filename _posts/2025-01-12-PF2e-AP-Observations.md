# Spore War
I just read Book 1 of the Spore War AP and here are a few things I liked/didn't like: 

- This AP is about the elven nation of Kyonin and the demon Treerazor. I don't particularly care for either but I find the idea of an AP about a war against a demonic force appealing.

- Book 1 opens with a cool encounter against undead to establish a bit of backstory for the PCs. I thought this was a pretty cool, action-packed way of opening the adventure.

- Next up is a long influence game. The goal is to forge an alliance between Kyonin and the other Isle of Terror nations. I don't care very much for the influence games in Paizo APs but at least the outcome of this one (supposedly) matters for the campaign. It generates a resource that can be spent in later parts of the AP to influence the larger war. It remains to be seen how well-designed this mechanic is. The influence portion itself has plenty of opportunities for roleplay and fun NPC interactions. I think this section could be better if there were more interesting ways of gaining influence than just rolling checks to flatter the NPCs. Especially in a high-level diplomatic negotiation, it would be more interesting to bargain over actual issues/resources to win influence. For example, maybe the PCs have authority over scarce bargaining chips (trade rights, military aid, new technology, etc.) that could be offered to NPCs to curry favor (or aid the influence checks), forcing the PCs to make trade-offs between the potential alliance partners.

- The negotiation ends in an assassination attempt, followed by an investigation. I found this section to be a fun follow-up and change of pace to the influence game. The investigation will lead the PCs to the city of Xer to find the mastermind behind the attack. Sadly, the second part of the investigation ends in a laughably linear sewer dungeon. I don't know what is going on at Paizo, but they have forgotten everything about dungeon design. The dungeon is literally a linear sequence of rooms with encounters **and** the second part of the dungeon is hidden behind a secret door that could be missed by the PCs. Honestly, this is a bit shameful.

- After the interlude in Xer, the PCs discover the threat to the city of Greengold and have to hasten back. In Greengold, they have to deal with a demonic spore infestation. There is a ticking clock and the PCs have to determine how to save the city before the second blossoming of the spores. The PCs have a temporary base from which to operate and can determine their course of action. This is a cool setup but the execution is lacking. First, the PCs have to determine the location of three root nodes that have to be destroyed before the final location with the book's villain can be accessed. That comes down to rolling well on research checks or, if the PCs fail, an NPC will just tell them. They can then proceed to destroy the three root nodes in whichever order they choose. Sadly, this is just fake player agency because it does not matter in which order the PCs go about this. In the end, it's just three necessary encounters that lead to the book's finale. This whole section of the book could have been a lot better if the ticking clock of the blossoming had been paired with a fun point crawl through the infested city. Give the PCs more options of identifying the important root nodes and make it meaningful how many or in which order they destroy them. Add random encounters (the book has some suggested additional events that are triggered by DM fiat). Give the PCs some actual choices to make with different risk-reward profiles that impact the finale of the book.

- Encounters: I did not study the encounters in any meaningful depth. At first glance, it looks like a good mix of low-to-severe threats with varying numbers of monsters and hazards.

- Overall, I thought this wasn't half bad. Even though there are real weak points and the overall structure of Book 1 is a railroad, I am interested in seeing the other two books and could see myself running this. If you are interested in elves, Kyonin, and Treerazer, this is a good AP to pick up. If you are not particularly tickled by these topics, I'd wait for Books 2 and 3.
