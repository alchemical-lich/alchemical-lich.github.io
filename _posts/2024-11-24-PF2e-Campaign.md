**30 Pharast 4721**: The Library

- The party buries their fallen comrade and restocks on supplies in town. 

- The next morning, they learn of a ghoul attack on town. Keeleno Lathenar was abducted out of his house, only a severed arm remaining. The group tracks the ghouls to some tunnels under the burned down tavern in town. It seems it is time to deal with the remaining ghouls in the Gauntlight.

- Deciding they need backup, they recruit a Gnome sorcerer in Crooks' Nook. Skrall promises to help them in exchange for a share of the treasure.

- They descend into the Library under the Gauntlight and move towards the Restricted Section. In the inner sanctum of the ghouls, they encounter their head priestess Nhakazarin and three ghouls. They stand around a large profane statue made of flesh, fashioned in the image of Belcorra. Arryn spots a guresome detail: both the remains of Keeleno Lathenar and tehir Morlock-Ghoul ally Augreal have been sown into the statue. 

- Nhakazarin beckons them to come closer. The party approaches carefully until the priestess reveals her plan to add them to the statue as well. A hard battle ensues, with the party barely surviving. Nhakazarin is slain, but the party is left in a bad shape. 

- They find a secret room on the Western side of the Temple, containing Belcorra's notes on the Gauntlight and the abominations within.

- They move South and find a smaller library. A ghostly figure appears, commanding them to work as scribes. The party complies to maintain the goodwill of the ghost. On the far side, they spot a skeleton with a shiny chainmail, cluthing a portrait of Volluk Azrinae. Eventually, they anger the ghost and the apparation drains the life out of Zazgaz. Before the worst comes to pass, they retreat to the surface.
