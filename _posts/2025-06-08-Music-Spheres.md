**Session 6 Music of the Spheres is Chaos**

The party attempts to exit the Alembic but is confronted by a large, four-headed worm and several chaos spawn emerging from the central pit. A terrible fight ensues and the heroes manage to flee to the outside at the last moment. They re-group over a delicious meal prepared by the halfling and strategize their next steps. It seems the Theophages created a chaos being that will eventually break free of the Alembic and attack the rest of the world. By turning the key, they may have accidentally accelerated this process.

They decide to return to the dungeon and destroy the beast. They make their way to the Water Vault and find a six-faced creature, born from a kiln, that attacks them. They use their spider powers to cover its faces with webbing and suffocate the strange creature. In a water-damaged library they find a cursed Theophage, forced to scribe scrolls for eternity. He answers their many questions and asks for the sweet release of death. Deeper in the Water Vault, they find the Queen of Water. She offers to close the elemental water channel in exchange for a worthy gift. Totino casts a mighty spell to animate a small coral statue and make it into a court jester. The Queen is pleased and helps the party. They move forward and return the Dwarven jewels to the Lord of Earth, who closes the last elemental channel.

The party enters the Alembic again to confront the Worm--in shock they realize that turning the Alembic further has transformed the Worm into a four-headed Chaos-Dragon. They attack with all their might. The cat lobs acid furballs into the beast's eyes, Totino unleashes a barrage of fire balls, the cook becomes whirlwind of frying pan and cooking knife, and Obi-Wan Cannoli channels her divine powers to inflict soul damage on the beast. The dragon attacks in turn, setting the dwarf on fire, steaming the bat to near-death. The halfing luckily dodges out of the way, but Obi-Wan Cannoli is hit my a stream of Void energy and nearly disintegrated! Nandor the dwarf jumps at the dragon, and in a daring attack, cuts of two of the heads in one go, slaying the beast! He shall be known henceforth as Lord Nandor the Dragon-Slayer!
