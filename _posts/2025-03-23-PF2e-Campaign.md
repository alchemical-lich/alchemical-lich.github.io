**7--8 Gozren 4721**: The Arena

The mummy Chafkem escapes and the heroes decide not to pursue further. In Chafkem's room, they find an enormous amount of writing on the walls--he essentially scribed his spellbook on the walls of his makeshift cell. The group wants to return to secure this valuable magical knowledge. 

The flee the Arena and return to Otari. The mayor provides them with the deed to the ruins of the Thirsty Alpaca and bestows upon them the title "Defender of Otari", which comes with a stipend of 40 gp per week. Arryn sets the soul crystal into the puppet they found a logm time ago. The puppet comes alvie and mourns the demise of his old master Volluk Azrinae. Arryn feels he has unlocked the technique of making such undead constructs.

The next morning, Zazgazan tutors young Dorianna Menhemes in physical activity and warfare lore.

The groups returns to the Arena level under the Gauntlight. After looting an alchemical supply closet, they successfully lure two Gigbas Bounders to fight an Otyugh.
