**22 Pharast 4721**: The Library

- The party deals with the two Ghoul Cultists. In the chaos of the melee, Corbin sees something strange in his mirror's reflection: a bright red ruby, lying on the floor and a person standing to the side, not fully visible. The person is wearing pointy, brocade shoes and flowy cloth pants. 

- The flesh effigy seems to have been fashioned from the remains of a Gibbering Mouther--foul beasts that can cause temporary insanity.

- The party re-groups and explores to the North. They find a small reading room with a fey occupant. The Lurker in the Light becomes agitated when Corbin takes one of "his" books and rejects Zazgaz' offer of some magical sling bullets. The creature turns vile and attacks. Zazgaz and Rizzard attack from two sides: Zazgaz hits the creature mid-flight and it tumbles to the ground; Rizzard jumps forward and grapples the nasty bugger. Before others can land a hit, the Fey bites down on Rizzard's arm and teleports away.

- In the reading room, the group recovers several interesting book--one outlining the creation of Poltergeists, the other a tome sought after by Morlibint.
