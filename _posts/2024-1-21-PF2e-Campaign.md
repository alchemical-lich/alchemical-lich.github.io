**7 Pharast 4721**: The Otari Fishery Camp and the Graveyard

- The party continues to clear out the Otari Fishery Camp. Corbin rejoins the others--and not one minute too late! Two sewer oozes give the group some trouble and Rizzard falls unconscious after a cruel strike by one of the oozes. Corbin comes to the rescue and destroys the enemy with the help of his occult knowledge.

- Eventually, they face off with a Web Lurker and two Giant Spiders. Again, Corbin strikes true, while a summoned wervitor by Arryn provides essential protection to the party. Victory is claimed and the party celebrates in anticipation of the offered reward of 50 gp.

- They decide to return to town the same night, despite their weary bones. They arrive at the Eastern cliff around 10:30 pm and discover an odd sight: a pale-ghostly light shine from the Gauntlight on Otari's graveyard.

- As they approach town, they hear the sounds of turmoil and panic. A scene of horror presents itself: the dead have risen from the graveyard and throw themselves from the Western cliff onto the Dawnflower Library.

- The heroes rush to the graveyard. Greeted by four terrified town guards, they enter the starkly illuminated boneyard. 

- As they carefully step between the old tombstones and family crypts, swaying bodies approach from the shadows. What seems like nearly a dozen of shambling corpses and rattling skeletons surge towards them, the unnatural force glimmering in their empty eyes hungering for their lives.

- Azgaz' wild swings, Rizzard's mighty spellstrikes, Arryn's godly prayers, and Corbin's methodical strikes end the fiends' unlife. For a second, quiet returns to the graveyard, except for a light breeze--it seems as if Pharasma herself means to carry away the crumbling remains of the undead.

- Suddenly, the eerie light from the Gauntlight tower flickers, re-focuses, and intensifies. Bright-blue light blinds the group and they see the outline of a strange, spider-like creature appear among them. A split second later, the light dies and the graveyard is plunged into complete darkness. Out of the shadows, a bony, oily thorn flies like a dagger at Rizzard. A wet sound. Then, warm, thick liquid spurts from his neck, coating a screaming town guard's face, as Rizzard's lifeless body hits the ground...Despite the shock of the moment, Corbin remembers having read about a creature like this. A hand-written note, scribbled in the margins of a moldy tome: "If you are wise, run for your life. If you are foolish, fight to the end--with fire."
