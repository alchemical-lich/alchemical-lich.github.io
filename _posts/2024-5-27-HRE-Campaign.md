**11/01/1631 -- 11/04/1631**:

- The Wolfguard begins construction on new buildings at their keep: 2 medium stone civilian buildings for housing a garrison and guests, 1 small stone civilian building to house an alchemy laboratory. They also send scouts to explore nearby hexes. By the river, they find an encampent of accursed outcasts. They visit the camp and "encourage" the outcasts to relocate.

- The Wolfguard travels West to visit Kloster Mariastein to recover a vial of holy water. On their travels they encounter some sheep herders, a brown bear, and a wandering pilgrim. At the foot of the mountain on which the abbey is perched, they rest at a Road Side Inn. They purchase winter clothing and begin their ascent. Close to the abbey, they happen upon a pack of wolves, but Authlbert is able to commune with them with the support of the Lidless Eye. Marching on through a blizzard, they make it to the Abbey's Ruins.
