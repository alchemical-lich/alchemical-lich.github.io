**18 Pharast 4721**: The Gauntlight Ruins

- The party moves into the room to the North and finds a circular chamber. A helix of necromantic energy stretched from the floor to the ceiling. Somehow, this is tied to the operation of the Gauntlight. A large, dead worm corpse lies in the room as well. Arryn studies the corpse and recovers a magical warhammer from its stomach.

- The exit the room through a door to the East. Beyond, a small hallway connects via two secret door to a small round room that seems to be a type of elevator. To the North, a door connects to a former torture room, broken instruments of pain strewn about. They push Westward a find a set of hallways that connect back East to the large North South hallway. A magical shimmer covers a door to the West. As Corbin approaches, magical writing appears on the floor: "I was Otari... save me from below!" The writing turns into a magical coil of energy, formed like a snake, and slithers East. The party pursues through hallways and a room but is stopped by a mighty skeletal minotaur that attacks them. Taking some wounds, they destroy the undead.

- They push further East. They discover a set of stairs leading down deeper below and a small set of stairs to a flooded cavern. After dealing with some brown mold, Arryn investigates the cavern, as a river drake pushes through the water's surface and attacks. Arryn, Zazgaz, and Rizzard are covered by a glob of spit. The party decides the wisest course of action is retreat. 

- They move back East and North, through a set of double doors. Five diorames depict the destruction of Absalom in various ways. Always, the Gauntlight is shown in a distance. As Rizzard approaches, a beam of energy shoots out from the first diorama and knocks him unconscious. The others pull him out to safety. Carefully triggering the energy beams, Rizzard moves to disable each of the magical traps. Taking severe injuries, the group secures the room. 

- They move through another set of double doors and find a former war room. Behind a large table, a spidery lurker creature beckons them inside. Communicating through gestures, it accepts a magical warhammer as tribute and commands Arryn ti polish its claws. After Arryn shows obedience, it dismisses the others and commands Arryn to complete additional tasks. Arryn spies a stash of valuables under the table. The spider creature activates an illusory map of Absalom on the table and begins to study it. Arryn attempts to make more overtures but only angers the beast. The creature approaches to teach Arryn a lesson...
