**9 Pharast 4721**: The Gauntlight Ruins

- The group decided to venture down the hidden stairs, entering the area below the groundlevel of the Gauntlight Ruins. They arrived in some cramped rooms and found several secret doors, connecting what seems to be a substantial basement level. In their exploration, they encountered a group of Morlocks. They engaged in battle and handled them swiftly, but one of the Morlocks ran away to alarm his Morlock allies. The party decided the prudent course of action was retreat.

- Back upstairs, they discovered a make-shift animal pen in the room south of the strange Chapel. In it, a famished giant scorpion was waiting for fresh prey. A quick scuttle ensued--Corbin was grabbed by the beasts claws, but quick strikes by Azgaz and Rizzard ended its life before it could harm Corbin further.

- The party decided to finally explore the Gauntlight copula. Upon entering the tower's base, the strange pool of blood on the floor congealed into the shape of a woman. The apparition opening its bloody mouth and eyes, emitting the same pale-blue light that raised the dead in the graveyard the night before. Bathed by the light, painful blisters emerged on everyone's skin and Rizzard was left temporarily blinded. A joint exorcism by Corbin and Arryn ended the haunt, but not before Rizzard nearly perished to a vicious blood-letting by the ghost.

- The bronze key opened the double doors barring access to the copula. Inside, they found a strange contraption: a metal and glass dome, containing swirling light and energy. Before any detailed investigation could unfold, the heroes were attacked by a Vampiric Mist. Luckily, their experience in adventuring made this short lived threat.
