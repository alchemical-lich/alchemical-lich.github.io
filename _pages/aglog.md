Here is a little hack of [Relic](https://lonely-adventurer.itch.io/relic-v3). This version is 95%+ the same as relic, I just made some little tweaks to the core rules and class line-up. It retains straightforward compatibility with B/X.

Here is an alternate version that repalces to-hit rolls with a single attack/damage roll, similar to Cairn and ItO.
