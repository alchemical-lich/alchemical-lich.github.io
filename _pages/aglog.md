Here is a little hack of [Relic](https://lonely-adventurer.itch.io/relic-v3), mashed together with ideas from [Cairn](https://cairnrpg.com/), Runecairn, and Into the Odd.

A lot of the text is based on [Relic](https://lonely-adventurer.itch.io/relic-v3) and Skerples [Many Rats on Sticks](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html). 

Important rule changes from Relic include replacing to-hit rolls with a single attack/damage roll, similar to Cairn and ItO. The attack roll is based on weapon damage dice and attribute bonuses. Different from ItO/Cairn, there is some inherent damage scaling through improving attribute scores and an extra attack feature, which makes it more similar to standard D&D than Cairn or ItO. There are also weapon-based maneuvers. It combines the quickness of the single attack roll, with the leveling- and power-scaling of standard B/X clones, and the class-flexibility of a GLoG.

This version also has only four main attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Wits, Personality (and Luck).

Conversions from B/X are less straightforward, but you might enjoy the different feel of combat.
