Here is a little hack of [Relic](https://lonely-adventurer.itch.io/relic-v3). This version is 90%+ the same as Relic, I just made some little tweaks to the core rules and class line-up. It retains straightforward compatibility with B/X.

[Core Rules](https://theophrastus-b0mbastus.github.io/aglog-rules/)

[Classes](https://theophrastus-b0mbastus.github.io/aglog-classes/)


Here is an alternate version that replaces to-hit rolls with a single attack/damage roll, similar to Cairn and ItO. The attack roll is weapon dice + attribute. There is also some inherent damage scaling through leveling and extra attack, which makes it more similar to standard DnD than Cairn or ItO.

This version also has only four main attributes.

Conversions from B/X are less straightforward, but you might enjoy the different feel of combat.
